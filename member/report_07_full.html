</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Context:</strong> The dramatic increase in "commodities not specified" imports from Japan to Haiti likely reflects emergency humanitarian aid or disaster relief supplies following a significant crisis, as Japan has historically provided substantial emergency assistance to Caribbean nations after natural disasters. This classification is commonly used for urgent shipments that bypass normal customs categorization processes during emergency response operations. The timing in January 2026 and the exceptional growth rate suggest this represents an acute response to immediate humanitarian needs rather than normal commercial trade patterns.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Haiti Experiences Dramatic Surge in Unspecified Japanese Imports</strong>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Haiti recorded an extraordinary 2,218.8% year-over-year increase in imports from Japan classified under "commodities not specified" (HS 9999) in January 2026, with shipment volumes reaching 83.7 thousand kilograms compared to just 3.6 thousand kilograms in the prior year period.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
This dramatic spike in unspecified commodities represents a departure from typical trade patterns between the two nations. While these imports maintain a negligible 0.0% share of Haiti's total import market, the exceptional growth rate and timing suggest circumstances beyond normal commercial activity.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The HS 9999 classification is typically reserved for goods that require expedited customs processing or fall outside standard commodity categories, often including emergency supplies, humanitarian aid, or disaster relief materials. Japan has a well-established history of providing rapid humanitarian assistance to Caribbean nations during crisis situations, making this a plausible explanation for the unusual trade data.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The January 2026 timing of this import surge indicates a response to immediate needs rather than planned commercial procurement. The substantial weight increase—from under 4 thousand to nearly 84 thousand kilograms—demonstrates the scale and urgency of whatever circumstances prompted these shipments.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Bill of lading-level customs data capturing weight, container volumes, and shipment details provides transparency into this trade flow, though the unspecified nature of the commodities limits insight into the exact goods involved. This pattern typically reflects emergency protocols that prioritize rapid delivery over detailed customs documentation, consistent with humanitarian response operations.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The data underscores Japan's continued engagement in Caribbean crisis response and Haiti's reliance on international assistance during challenging periods.

<p class="story-para">
<em>YoY +451.2% | YTD 604.8k kg | Share 0.2% | Source: Anomaly Detection</em>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Context:</strong> The dramatic 451% increase in Haiti's imports of vegetable coloring matter from India likely reflects a supply chain diversification away from traditional sources, as Caribbean nations have increasingly sought more cost-effective alternatives to European and North American suppliers for food and textile dyes. This surge may also indicate growing demand from Haiti's textile manufacturing sector, which serves both domestic markets and regional export opportunities, with Indian suppliers offering competitive pricing and reliable supply chains that have become particularly attractive post-pandemic.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Haiti Significantly Increases Vegetable Coloring Matter Imports from India</strong>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Haiti's imports of vegetable coloring matter from India have experienced remarkable growth, with shipment volumes reaching 604,800 kilograms year-to-date compared to just 109,700 kilograms in the prior year period. This represents a substantial 451.2% year-over-year increase, according to bill-of-lading level customs data tracking weight, container volumes, and shipment frequencies.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Despite this dramatic growth, Indian vegetable coloring matter still represents a modest 0.2% share of Haiti's total import portfolio, suggesting significant room for continued expansion. The surge reflects a broader trend of Caribbean nations diversifying their supply chains away from traditional North American and European sources toward more cost-effective Asian alternatives.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The substantial increase likely stems from multiple factors affecting Haiti's industrial landscape. The country's textile manufacturing sector, which serves both domestic consumption and regional export markets, has been seeking reliable, competitively-priced raw materials. Indian suppliers have emerged as attractive partners, offering established supply chains and favorable pricing structures that became particularly valuable following global supply chain disruptions.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Additionally, Haiti's food processing industry may be driving increased demand for natural coloring agents as consumer preferences shift toward plant-based additives. Indian manufacturers, with their extensive experience in vegetable-derived industrial materials, are well-positioned to meet this growing demand.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The data indicates Haiti is successfully establishing new trade relationships that could provide greater supply chain resilience and cost advantages. As these commercial ties strengthen, further growth in this import category appears likely, potentially supporting Haiti's manufacturing competitiveness in regional markets.

<h2 class="story-heading">Story 3: USA — Commodities not specified (HS 9999)</h2>
<p class="story-para">
<em>YoY -95.4% | YTD 9.5M kg | Share 2.3% | Source: Anomaly Detection</em>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Context:</strong> The dramatic 95.4% decline in unspecified commodity imports from the USA to Haiti in January 2026 likely reflects the severe disruption of trade flows due to Haiti's ongoing security crisis, with gang violence controlling major ports and transportation routes making regular commercial imports extremely difficult. The "commodities not specified" category often includes essential goods like food, fuel, and medical supplies that would typically flow regularly from the US as Haiti's largest trading partner, but current instability has forced importers to either halt operations or seek alternative routing through Dominican Republic or other Caribbean transshipment points. This collapse in formal trade flows also coincides with reduced humanitarian and commercial confidence in Haiti's ability to receive and distribute goods safely through traditional supply chain channels.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Haiti Import Report: Unspecified Commodities from USA</strong>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Haiti's imports of unspecified commodities (HS 9999) from the United States experienced a catastrophic collapse in January 2026, falling 95.4% year-over-year to just 9.5 million kilograms compared to 207.4 million kilograms in the prior year period. This dramatic decline reduced the category's share of Haiti's total imports to 2.3%, highlighting the severe disruption of traditional trade flows between Haiti and its largest trading partner.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The "commodities not specified" classification typically encompasses essential goods including food products, fuel, medical supplies, and other critical imports that form the backbone of Haiti's commercial supply chain. The near-total collapse of these imports reflects the profound impact of Haiti's ongoing security crisis on normal trade operations.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The extreme decline is primarily attributable to the deteriorating security situation, with armed gangs maintaining control over key infrastructure including the Port-au-Prince port and major transportation corridors. This has made routine commercial imports extremely hazardous and logistically challenging for traditional importers and shipping companies.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Many businesses and humanitarian organizations have been forced to suspend operations or seek alternative routing through the Dominican Republic and other Caribbean transshipment points, which often fall outside standard bilateral trade statistics. The formal customs data captured in this BOL-level analysis represents only goods successfully cleared through Haiti's official ports, missing the growing volume of goods entering through alternative channels.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
This collapse in formal trade flows indicates not just immediate supply chain disruptions, but also reflects diminished commercial confidence in Haiti's capacity to receive and distribute goods through conventional import channels during this period of unprecedented instability.

<h2 class="story-heading">Story 4: PAKISTAN — Rice (HS 1006)</h2>
<p class="story-para">
<em>YoY -93.8% | YTD 6.5M kg | Share 1.6% | Source: Country-Commodity Growth</em>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Context:</strong> Haiti's rice imports from Pakistan declined by 93.8% in January 2026, likely reflecting a sourcing shift toward more dominant suppliers like the United States, which typically accounts for the majority of Haiti's rice imports through preferential trade arrangements and established supply chains. This dramatic reduction may also indicate Haiti's continued reliance on regional suppliers and traditional trade partners in the Americas, where transportation costs and logistics are more favorable than the longer shipping routes from Pakistan. Additionally, this could represent a normalization after any temporary supply disruptions that may have previously elevated Pakistani rice imports above typical levels.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Haiti's Rice Imports from Pakistan Plummet in Early 2026</strong>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Haiti's rice imports from Pakistan experienced a dramatic decline in January 2026, dropping 93.8% year-over-year to 6.5 million kilograms compared to 104.7 million kilograms in the prior year period. This sharp contraction reduced Pakistan's share of Haiti's total rice imports to just 1.6%, highlighting a significant shift in the country's sourcing patterns.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The substantial decrease likely reflects Haiti's return to traditional supply chains dominated by regional partners, particularly the United States, which historically provides the majority of Haiti's rice through established trade agreements and preferential arrangements. These long-standing commercial relationships offer Haiti more favorable terms and shorter shipping routes compared to Pakistani suppliers.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Transportation economics appear to play a crucial role in this sourcing shift. Rice shipments from Pakistan require longer ocean transit times and higher logistics costs than supplies from North and South American producers. For a price-sensitive commodity like rice, which serves as a dietary staple for Haiti's population, these cost differentials significantly impact purchasing decisions.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The data suggests this decline may represent a normalization of trade flows rather than a sudden disruption. Pakistan's reduced presence in Haiti's rice market aligns with broader regional trading patterns, where Caribbean nations typically source agricultural commodities from geographically closer suppliers in the Americas.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
This trend reflects Haiti's ongoing efforts to optimize its food import strategy amid economic constraints, prioritizing cost-effective sourcing channels that ensure reliable access to essential commodities while managing foreign exchange pressures.

<p class="story-para">
<em>YoY -93.6% | YTD 7.5M kg | Share 1.9% | Source: Anomaly Detection</em>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Context:</strong> The 93.6% decline in Portland cement imports from Dominican Republic likely reflects Haiti's severely constrained construction sector due to ongoing security challenges and economic instability that have reduced infrastructure projects and building activity. Additionally, this may indicate supply chain disruptions caused by deteriorating conditions at Haiti's ports, particularly Port-au-Prince, which have made import operations increasingly difficult and expensive for Dominican suppliers.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Haiti's Cement Imports from Dominican Republic Plummet 94% in Early 2026</strong>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Haiti's imports of Portland cement from the Dominican Republic have collapsed dramatically, with shipments totaling just 7.5 million kilograms year-to-date compared to 117.2 million kilograms in the prior year period. This represents a severe 93.6% decline, reducing the Dominican Republic's share of Haiti's total cement imports to merely 1.9%.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The dramatic drop in cement imports reflects Haiti's severely constrained construction sector, which has been crippled by ongoing security challenges and economic instability. Infrastructure projects and building activities have been sharply curtailed as businesses and developers delay or cancel construction plans amid the deteriorating security environment.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Supply chain disruptions have further complicated import operations. Haiti's ports, particularly the critical Port-au-Prince facility, have faced increasing operational difficulties that have made cement shipments more expensive and logistically challenging for Dominican suppliers. These port-related constraints have created significant barriers to maintaining regular trade flows of heavy construction materials.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The cement trade decline also highlights broader economic pressures facing Haiti, where reduced investment in infrastructure and private construction projects has diminished demand for building materials. Dominican cement producers, who previously relied on Haiti as a key export market, have likely redirected shipments to more stable regional markets.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
According to bill-of-lading level customs data tracking weight, container volumes, and shipment frequencies, the January 2026 figures suggest this trend may continue unless Haiti's security situation stabilizes and port operations improve. The construction sector's recovery will likely depend on broader improvements in Haiti's political and economic stability.

<em>YoY -93.5% | YTD 5.3M kg | Share 1.3% | Source: Country-Commodity Growth</em>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Context:</strong> The dramatic 93.5% decline in Haiti's palm oil imports from Indonesia in January 2026 likely reflects the country's severe economic and security crisis, which has significantly reduced purchasing power and disrupted import financing capabilities. Haiti's ongoing political instability and gang violence have also severely impacted port operations and distribution networks, making it extremely difficult to maintain regular commodity imports. Additionally, Haiti may have shifted to sourcing palm oil from closer regional suppliers or through different trade routes to reduce logistics risks and costs amid the crisis.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Haiti's Palm Oil Imports from Indonesia Collapse Amid Ongoing Crisis</strong>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Haiti's palm oil imports from Indonesia experienced a dramatic collapse in January 2026, with import volumes plummeting 93.5% year-over-year to just 5.3 million kilograms, down from 82.3 million kilograms in the prior year period. This sharp decline reduced Indonesia's market share in Haiti's palm oil sector to merely 1.3% of total imports.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The catastrophic drop in palm oil imports reflects Haiti's deepening economic and security crisis, which has severely constrained the country's import capacity. Chronic foreign exchange shortages and limited access to trade financing have made it increasingly difficult for Haitian importers to maintain regular commodity purchases, particularly for non-essential goods like palm oil used in food processing and manufacturing.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Haiti's deteriorating security situation has compounded these challenges, with widespread gang violence disrupting port operations and inland distribution networks. The Port-au-Prince port, Haiti's primary entry point for imports, has faced periodic closures and operational constraints that make large-scale commodity imports logistically challenging and economically unviable.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The data, derived from bill-of-lading customs records tracking shipment weights, container volumes, and TEU movements, illustrates the broader collapse of Haiti's formal import trade. The country may be increasingly relying on smaller-scale imports from regional suppliers or alternative trade routes that offer greater flexibility and reduced security risks.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
This dramatic decline in Indonesian palm oil imports underscores Haiti's shrinking integration with global supply chains and its growing dependence on regional trade networks amid persistent political instability and economic deterioration.

<p class="story-para">
<em>YoY -91.5% | YTD 38.1M kg | Share 9.5% | Source: Anomaly Detection</em>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Context:</strong> The dramatic 91.5% decline in Portland cement imports from Turkey to Haiti likely reflects the country's ongoing economic and political instability, which has severely constrained construction activity and infrastructure development demand. Haiti's persistent foreign exchange shortages and banking sector difficulties have made it increasingly challenging for importers to secure letters of credit for international purchases, particularly for heavy construction materials like cement. Additionally, Haiti may have shifted toward more regional suppliers or increased reliance on domestic cement production to reduce import dependence amid currency devaluation pressures.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Haiti's Cement Imports from Turkey Plummet Amid Economic Constraints</strong>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Haiti's imports of Portland cement from Turkey experienced a dramatic collapse in early 2026, with shipments falling 91.5% year-over-year to 38.1 million kilograms compared to 449.9 million kilograms in the prior year period. Despite this steep decline, Turkish cement still maintained a 9.5% share of Haiti's total cement import market.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The sharp reduction in cement imports reflects Haiti's deepening economic crisis, which has severely curtailed construction activity and infrastructure development across the country. Persistent foreign exchange shortages have made it increasingly difficult for Haitian importers to secure the letters of credit necessary for international purchases, particularly for heavy construction materials requiring substantial upfront payments.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Haiti's ongoing political instability has further dampened demand for cement, as uncertainty discourages both private construction projects and public infrastructure investments. The construction sector, traditionally a major cement consumer, has contracted significantly as businesses and government agencies delay or cancel building projects.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Currency devaluation pressures have also made imported cement increasingly expensive for local buyers, potentially driving some consumers toward alternative suppliers or domestic production options. The banking sector's continued difficulties have compounded these challenges by limiting trade financing availability.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The data, derived from bill-of-lading level customs records tracking weight, container volumes, and shipment patterns, illustrates how Haiti's economic constraints are reshaping its import patterns. While Turkey previously served as a significant cement supplier, the current trajectory suggests Haitian importers may be seeking more cost-effective regional alternatives or reducing overall cement procurement in response to weakened domestic demand and financing constraints.

<p class="story-para">
Haiti's rice imports from the United States experienced a dramatic collapse in January 2026, falling 91.1% year-over-year to just 30.6 million kilograms compared to 345.0 million kilograms in the prior year period. This sharp decline reduced the USA's share of Haiti's total rice imports to 7.6%, highlighting a significant disruption in what has traditionally been a critical food supply relationship.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The precipitous drop reflects the severe operational challenges facing Haiti's import infrastructure amid ongoing gang violence and port disruptions that have intensified since 2021. Key entry points, particularly Port-au-Prince, have faced repeated closures and security threats, making it extremely difficult for importers to receive and distribute essential goods like rice, a staple food for millions of Haitians.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
BOL-level customs data reveals the stark reality of Haiti's current trade environment, where traditional commercial rice imports have become increasingly unfeasible. The country's persistent foreign currency shortages and broader economic instability have further constrained both government and private sector capacity to finance food imports through conventional channels.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
This dramatic reduction in commercial rice flows likely indicates a shift toward alternative supply mechanisms, including emergency humanitarian aid deliveries and imports from regional suppliers that may offer more flexible payment terms or shorter transportation routes. However, such alternatives cannot easily replace the scale of rice imports that Haiti historically received from the United States.

Haiti's petroleum oil imports from the US Virgin Islands experienced a dramatic collapse in January 2026, with shipment volumes dropping to 55.4 million kilograms compared to 519.9 million kilograms in the same period the previous year—representing an 89.3% year-over-year decline. Despite this sharp reduction, US Virgin Islands petroleum products still maintained a 13.8% share of Haiti's total import market.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The massive decline in petroleum imports reflects Haiti's deteriorating security situation and its cascading effects on critical infrastructure. Gang violence that has plagued the country since 2021 continues to severely disrupt port operations and fuel distribution networks, making it increasingly difficult to maintain regular supply chains. The Port-au-Prince port, Haiti's primary entry point for petroleum products, has faced repeated closures and security threats that have forced importers to seek alternative arrangements or reduce operations entirely.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
This supply disruption has likely compelled Haiti to diversify its petroleum sourcing beyond traditional Caribbean suppliers like the US Virgin Islands. The country may be increasingly relying on different regional partners or adjusting import schedules to work around security constraints. The reduced import volumes also suggest that Haiti's overall fuel consumption has decreased significantly, reflecting broader economic paralysis caused by ongoing instability.

<em>YoY -86.1% | YTD 32.9M kg | Share 8.2% | Source: Anomaly Detection</em>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Context:</strong> The dramatic 86% decline in Portland cement imports from Egypt likely reflects Haiti's shift toward regional suppliers, as Caribbean and Central American sources typically offer lower transportation costs and shorter lead times for this heavy, low-value commodity. Additionally, Haiti's construction sector may be experiencing reduced demand due to ongoing economic challenges and political instability, which have historically impacted infrastructure development and private construction activity. The country may also be increasing imports from traditional suppliers like the Dominican Republic or Colombia, which have established trade relationships and proximity advantages over distant Egyptian suppliers.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Haiti's Cement Imports from Egypt Plummet 86% Year-over-Year</strong>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Haiti's imports of Portland cement from Egypt have declined dramatically, falling to 32.9 million kilograms year-to-date compared to 236.5 million kilograms in the prior year period—an 86.1% decrease according to bill-of-lading level customs data. Despite this sharp contraction, Egyptian cement still maintains an 8.2% share of Haiti's total cement imports.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The precipitous decline likely reflects Haiti's strategic shift toward more economically viable regional suppliers. Portland cement, a heavy and relatively low-value commodity, incurs substantial transportation costs when shipped from distant markets like Egypt. Caribbean and Central American suppliers typically offer significant advantages in freight costs and delivery times, making them more attractive alternatives for Haitian importers.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
This import pattern also mirrors broader challenges facing Haiti's construction sector. The country's ongoing economic difficulties and political instability have historically constrained both public infrastructure projects and private construction activity, reducing overall cement demand. When demand does exist, buyers naturally gravitate toward suppliers offering the most competitive delivered pricing.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The shift away from Egyptian cement suggests Haitian importers are likely increasing their reliance on traditional regional partners, particularly the neighboring Dominican Republic and South American suppliers like Colombia. These markets have established trade relationships with Haiti and benefit from proximity advantages that distant suppliers cannot match.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
While the 8.2% market share indicates Egypt retains some presence in Haiti's cement market, the magnitude of the year-over-year decline signals a fundamental reorientation toward regional sourcing strategies that better align with the economic realities of importing heavy construction materials.

</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Context:</strong> The dramatic 84% decline in sugar imports from Guatemala to Haiti in January 2026 likely reflects Haiti's ongoing economic and political instability, which has severely disrupted import financing and distribution networks throughout the country. Additionally, this could indicate a shift toward sourcing sugar from closer Caribbean suppliers or through different trade corridors, as Guatemala is relatively distant compared to other regional sugar producers like the Dominican Republic or Brazil, making those alternatives more cost-effective amid Haiti's foreign exchange constraints.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
<strong>Haiti Sugar Imports from Guatemala Plummet 84% in January 2026</strong>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Haiti's sugar imports from Guatemala experienced a dramatic collapse in January 2026, with shipments of cane and beet sugar (HS code 1701) dropping to just 7.7 million kilograms compared to 49.2 million kilograms in the same period last year. This represents an 84.3% year-over-year decline, reducing Guatemala's market share to only 1.9% of Haiti's total sugar imports.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The sharp contraction reflects Haiti's deepening economic crisis, which has severely constrained import financing capabilities and disrupted traditional supply chains. Foreign exchange shortages have made it increasingly difficult for Haitian importers to maintain letters of credit and other trade financing instruments necessary for international transactions, particularly for non-essential commodities like refined sugar.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Guatemala's geographic distance from Haiti has likely exacerbated these challenges, as longer shipping routes increase costs and complexity compared to closer regional suppliers. The Dominican Republic, sharing the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, and other Caribbean sugar producers offer more viable alternatives given current logistical and financial constraints.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Political instability has further complicated Haiti's import landscape, with port operations frequently disrupted and distribution networks hampered by security concerns. These factors have pushed importers toward more reliable, shorter supply chains when possible.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
