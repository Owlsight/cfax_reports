<p>---</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As 2025 began, Haiti remained one of the world's most challenging trade environments. Years of political instability, gang violence, and natural disasters had reduced import flows to crisis levels, with essential supply chains operating at bare minimum capacity. Port facilities remained partially compromised, and international suppliers had grown cautious about Haitian market commitments.</p>
<p>Yet the bill-of-lading data tells a different story—one of gradual but determined recovery. What emerged over the twelve months was not just a return to previous trade patterns, but a fundamental restructuring of Haiti's import relationships. Traditional suppliers faced new competition, energy security took on strategic importance, and construction materials became the dominant trade story as reconstruction priorities drove import decisions.</p>
<p>The numbers reveal a country making deliberate choices about its economic future. This is the story of how Haiti's trade flows in 2025 reflected both recovery and strategic reorientation.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>Part I: The Recovery Story</h2>
<p>Haiti's import recovery in 2025 represented more than statistical improvement—it signaled the country's gradual emergence from years of trade disruption and supply chain crisis. Total imports reached 4.09 billion kilograms, growing 4.3% year-over-year from 3.92 billion kilograms in 2024. While this growth rate appears modest, the underlying dynamics reveal a more dramatic transformation.</p>
<p>The most striking indicator of recovery came through container traffic. Haiti processed 101,476 TEU in 2025, a remarkable 29.5% increase from 78,348 TEU the previous year. This surge in containerized trade suggests that port infrastructure had stabilized sufficiently to handle increased volume, and that international shipping lines had regained confidence in Haitian trade routes. The disparity between modest weight growth and substantial container growth indicates a shift toward higher-value, manufactured goods that require container shipping rather than bulk transport.</p>
<p>Monthly patterns throughout 2025 revealed the uneven nature of this recovery. The year began with January imports of 312 million kilograms, actually down 15.4% from January 2024, suggesting that the security and logistical challenges that had disrupted 2024 trade flows carried over into early 2025. However, by March, import volumes reached 293 million kilograms, up 24.9% year-over-year, indicating that trade normalization accelerated through the first quarter.</p>
<p>The strongest growth period came during the second quarter, with April showing particularly dramatic increases. Import volumes reached 321 million kilograms in April, an 88.9% increase from the previous year, while container traffic jumped 84.3%. This surge suggests that by spring 2025, both Haitian importers and international suppliers had regained sufficient confidence to resume more normal trading relationships.</p>
<p>Geographic diversification became a hallmark of Haiti's 2025 import strategy. While the United States remained the largest single supplier at 1.17 billion kilograms, American market share actually declined to 28.6% as Haiti expanded relationships with regional Caribbean partners and Asian suppliers. This diversification appears strategic rather than accidental, with specific countries gaining market share in targeted commodity categories.</p>
<p>The data reveals 1,767 unique country-commodity flows in 2025, with 648 flows showing positive growth compared to 424 declining flows. This nearly 3:2 ratio of expanding versus contracting trade relationships indicates that Haiti's import recovery was broad-based rather than concentrated in a few key areas. Countries experiencing the most dramatic growth—Suriname (+421,450,000%), Barbados (+300,510,300%), and Sri Lanka (+52,166,400%)—started from extremely low baseline levels, suggesting that Haiti was actively exploring new supplier relationships as traditional trade patterns normalized.</p>
<p>The sectoral composition of imports also shifted significantly. Mineral products, primarily cement and petroleum, dominated at 45% of total import weight, reflecting both energy security needs and infrastructure reconstruction priorities. This concentration in basic materials suggests that Haiti's import priorities remained focused on fundamental economic recovery rather than consumer goods or luxury items.</p>
<p>Container utilization patterns provide additional insight into trade normalization. The average shipment size decreased as container volumes grew faster than total weight, indicating more frequent, smaller shipments rather than the irregular large shipments that characterized crisis-period trade. This pattern suggests that normal commercial relationships were resuming, with regular ordering cycles replacing emergency procurement patterns.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>Part II: The Cement Revolution</h2>
<p>Portland cement emerged as the dominant story in Haiti's 2025 import landscape, with total imports reaching 1.05 billion kilograms, representing 25.7% of all goods entering the country. This massive volume, up 30.1% from 810 million kilograms in 2024, reflects both Haiti's urgent reconstruction needs and a dramatic reshuffling of supplier relationships that challenged decades-old trade patterns.</p>
<p>Turkey maintained its position as Haiti's largest cement supplier, providing 450 million kilograms, but its market dominance eroded significantly. Turkish cement shipments actually declined 2.5% year-over-year, reducing Turkey's share of Haiti's cement market from 57% to 43%. This shift occurred despite Turkey's established trade relationships and logistical advantages, suggesting that Haitian importers actively sought alternative suppliers to meet surging demand.</p>
<p>Vietnam emerged as the most dramatic success story in Haiti's cement market, with imports exploding from 57 million kilograms in 2024 to 149 million kilograms in 2025—a 161.6% increase. This surge elevated Vietnam to become Haiti's third-largest cement supplier, capturing 14.2% of the market. Vietnamese cement arrived through 25 separate shipments, suggesting systematic rather than opportunistic trade relationships. The Vietnamese cement influx likely reflects competitive pricing and availability as Haiti's construction sector accelerated.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic achieved even more spectacular growth, though from a smaller baseline. Dominican cement imports jumped from 15 million kilograms to 117 million kilograms, representing a 686.6% increase that elevated the neighboring country to 11.1% market share. This surge appears particularly strategic, given the Dominican Republic's geographic proximity and shared infrastructure interests with Haiti. The 15 separate shipments indicate regular supply relationships rather than one-off transactions.</p>
<p>Panama similarly capitalized on Haiti's cement boom, with imports increasing 541.9% to 64 million kilograms. This growth positioned Panama as a significant supplier with 6.1% market share, suggesting that Central American suppliers successfully competed for Haitian construction material contracts. The Panamanian surge, combined with Dominican and Vietnamese gains, illustrates how Haiti's cement demand created opportunities for non-traditional suppliers to establish market positions.</p>
<p>Egypt, previously a major supplier, maintained steady volumes at 237 million kilograms but saw its market share decline from 29% to 22% as overall demand expanded. Egyptian cement shipments decreased slightly (-0.3%), suggesting that Egypt maintained its existing supply relationships but did not capture additional volume as the market grew. The 25 shipments from Egypt indicate continued regular trade, but without the expansion seen from other suppliers.</p>
<p>The cement import surge coincided with specific reconstruction priorities evident throughout 2025. The timing patterns show consistent monthly demand rather than seasonal spikes, suggesting sustained construction activity rather than project-specific imports. The variety of suppliers—spanning Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and Central America—indicates that Haitian importers prioritized volume and competitive pricing over traditional supplier relationships.</p>
<p>This cement revolution reflects broader changes in Haiti's approach to infrastructure rebuilding. Rather than relying on established suppliers, Haitian importers demonstrated willingness to diversify sourcing to meet unprecedented demand. The successful entry of Vietnam, Dominican Republic, and Panama into Haiti's cement market suggests that competitive pricing and reliable supply chains mattered more than historical relationships.</p>
<p>The scale of cement imports also indicates the ambitious scope of Haiti's reconstruction efforts in 2025. Over one billion kilograms of cement represents sufficient material for substantial infrastructure projects, from housing reconstruction to public works initiatives. The sustained high volumes throughout the year suggest that construction activity maintained momentum rather than experiencing the stop-start patterns typical of project-based development.</p>
<p>The cement data reveals Haiti's import strategy becoming more sophisticated and globally oriented. By successfully integrating new suppliers while maintaining relationships with established partners, Haitian importers achieved both volume growth and supply security. This approach may serve as a model for other commodity categories as Haiti continues its economic recovery and infrastructure development.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>Part III: Energy Security Moves</h2>
<p>Haiti's petroleum import patterns in 2025 revealed a strategic shift toward regional energy suppliers that fundamentally altered the country's fuel supply chains. Total petroleum imports reached 670 million kilograms, growing modestly by 4.7% from the previous year, but the supplier composition changed dramatically as Haiti reduced dependence on direct US imports in favor of Caribbean-based sources.</p>
<p>The US Virgin Islands emerged as Haiti's dominant petroleum supplier, providing 520 million kilograms of refined oil products—a 48.8% increase from 349 million kilograms in 2024. This surge elevated the US Virgin Islands to 77.6% of Haiti's petroleum market, making it by far the largest single supplier of energy products. The 181 shipments from the US Virgin Islands throughout 2025 indicate systematic supply relationships rather than opportunistic purchases.</p>
<p>This shift toward Virgin Islands petroleum likely reflects multiple strategic considerations. The US Virgin Islands maintains sophisticated refining capacity and established Caribbean distribution networks, potentially offering competitive pricing and reliable supply chains. Additionally, Virgin Islands-sourced petroleum may provide supply security advantages, with shorter shipping distances and reduced exposure to mainland US distribution disruptions.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, direct petroleum imports from the United States declined significantly, dropping from 197 million kilograms in 2024 to 137 million kilograms in 2025—a 30.5% decrease. This reduction coincided with the Virgin Islands surge, suggesting deliberate sourcing substitution rather than overall demand changes. US petroleum shipments totaled 213 deliveries, indicating continued regular trade relationships despite reduced volumes.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic, previously a significant petroleum supplier with 66 million kilograms in 2024, experienced a dramatic decline to just 11 million kilograms in 2025—an 83.8% reduction. This collapse suggests that Dominican petroleum became less competitive or available as Haiti's Virgin Islands relationships expanded. The shift away from Dominican petroleum, combined with Virgin Islands growth, indicates that Haiti prioritized supply reliability and pricing over geographic proximity.</p>
<p>Guatemala maintained a smaller but growing role in Haiti's petroleum supply chain, with imports increasing 40.8% to 755,000 kilograms. While representing just 0.1% of Haiti's petroleum market, Guatemalan supplies indicate Haiti's willingness to explore diverse sourcing options. The United Arab Emirates similarly provided modest volumes at 504,000 kilograms, up 13% year-over-year, suggesting that even small-scale suppliers found opportunities in Haiti's energy market.</p>
<p>The petroleum import patterns reflect Haiti's energy security priorities during 2025. Rather than relying heavily on direct US imports, Haiti developed stronger relationships with US Virgin Islands suppliers that likely offered advantages in pricing, logistics, and supply consistency. This shift demonstrates sophisticated procurement strategies that balanced energy security with commercial considerations.</p>
<p>Monthly petroleum import patterns remained relatively steady throughout 2025, suggesting consistent energy demand rather than seasonal variations or supply disruptions. The regularity of Virgin Islands shipments—181 deliveries across twelve months—indicates that supply relationships had stabilized by 2025, contrasting with the irregular procurement patterns that characterized earlier crisis periods.</p>
<p>The energy supply diversification also reflects Haiti's broader import strategy of reducing dependence on single suppliers or traditional relationships. By developing Virgin Islands petroleum supplies while maintaining US relationships, Haiti created more resilient energy supply chains. This approach mirrors the diversification evident in cement and other commodity categories.</p>
<p>The scale of petroleum imports—670 million kilograms—represents substantial energy consumption that supported Haiti's economic recovery activities. The steady volumes throughout 2025 suggest that energy supply disruptions, which had characterized previous years, were largely resolved through the new supplier relationships.</p>
<p>Container utilization for petroleum imports indicates a mix of bulk and containerized deliveries, with 901 TEU suggesting that some refined products arrived in containers rather than bulk tankers. This delivery method diversity provides additional supply chain flexibility and may reflect the Virgin Islands' sophisticated distribution capabilities.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>Part IV: The China Surge</h2>
<p>Chinese imports to Haiti experienced a remarkable transformation in 2025, surging 83% to reach 312 million kilograms compared to 171 million kilograms the previous year. This dramatic growth elevated China to become Haiti's fourth-largest supplier, capturing 7.6% of total import market share and signaling a potential restructuring of Haiti's manufacturing supply chains.</p>
<p>The surge was dominated by unspecified commodities classified under HS 9999, which doubled from 27 million kilograms to 56 million kilograms. These "commodities not specified according to kind" represented 19.6% of Haiti's total unspecified imports, suggesting that Chinese suppliers were providing manufacturing inputs, components, or specialized products that don't fit standard trade classifications. The substantial volume of unspecified goods indicates complex supply relationships rather than simple commodity trading.</p>
<p>Chinese container traffic to Haiti reflected the manufacturing-oriented nature of these imports, with 27,073 TEU representing sophisticated logistics operations. The 8,432 individual shipments from China—averaging about 700 shipments per month—indicate systematic trade relationships rather than opportunistic purchases. This shipment frequency suggests that Chinese suppliers had established regular distribution networks to serve Haitian importers.</p>
<p>The timing of China's import surge coincided with Haiti's broader economic recovery, suggesting that Chinese suppliers successfully positioned themselves to serve Haiti's reconstructing economy. The 83% growth rate far exceeded Haiti's overall import growth of 4.3%, indicating that Chinese suppliers captured disproportionate market share as trade relationships normalized.</p>
<p>Beyond unspecified commodities, Chinese imports likely included manufacturing equipment, electronics, consumer goods, and construction materials that supported Haiti's infrastructure rebuilding efforts. The container-heavy nature of Chinese shipments—averaging 3.2 TEU per shipment—suggests higher-value manufactured goods rather than bulk commodities.</p>
<p>The Chinese import surge occurred as Haiti's traditional suppliers faced various challenges. While US imports declined 6.5% and represented a smaller share of Haiti's total trade, Chinese suppliers successfully expanded their market presence. This shift suggests that competitive pricing, product availability, and willingness to serve challenging markets gave Chinese exporters advantages in Haiti's recovering economy.</p>
<p>The diversification toward Chinese suppliers also reflects Haiti's broader strategy of expanding sourcing relationships beyond traditional Caribbean and North American partners. By developing substantial Chinese import relationships, Haiti gained access to global manufacturing capacity and potentially more competitive pricing for manufactured goods and industrial inputs.</p>
<p>Chinese shipping patterns to Haiti showed consistency throughout 2025, with regular monthly deliveries rather than seasonal concentrations. This regularity indicates that Chinese suppliers had developed sustainable logistics solutions for serving the Haitian market, overcoming the infrastructure and security challenges that had deterred other international suppliers.</p>
<p>The substantial volume of unspecified Chinese imports raises questions about the specific nature of these goods and their role in Haiti's economic development. These imports could include manufacturing equipment for export processing zones, consumer electronics for domestic markets, or specialized components for infrastructure projects. The classification as "unspecified" suggests complex or customized products rather than standard commodity items.</p>
<p>The Chinese import growth also occurred against the backdrop of global supply chain shifts and US-China trade tensions. Chinese suppliers may have found Haiti an attractive market for products and manufacturing capacity as other global relationships became more complex. Haiti's openness to Chinese imports provided opportunities for suppliers seeking market diversification.</p>
<p>The success of Chinese suppliers in Haiti's market demonstrates the global integration of supply chains even in challenging trade environments. Despite Haiti's infrastructure limitations and security concerns, Chinese exporters successfully established substantial trade relationships that contributed significantly to Haiti's import recovery.</p>
<p>Looking at the containerized nature of Chinese imports—27,073 TEU—suggests that these goods required sophisticated handling and distribution networks. Chinese suppliers apparently developed the logistics capabilities necessary to serve Haiti effectively, indicating long-term market commitment rather than short-term opportunism.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>Part V: Food Security Pivot</h2>
<p>Haiti's agricultural import patterns in 2025 revealed a strategic shift in food security approaches, with traditional rice dependence giving way to wheat diversification and new supplier relationships that reflected both changing dietary preferences and supply chain pragmatism.</p>
<p>Rice remained Haiti's third-largest import by volume at 477 million kilograms, but total rice imports declined 7.9% from 518 million kilograms in 2024. This reduction occurred across multiple suppliers and suggests genuine demand changes rather than sourcing substitution. The decline in rice imports, combined with dramatic wheat growth, indicates a potential shift in Haiti's dietary composition and food security strategy.</p>
<p>The United States maintained its dominance in Haiti's rice market, supplying 345 million kilograms through 85 shipments, representing 72.3% of total rice imports. However, US rice supplies declined 2.6% from the previous year, suggesting that even the primary supplier experienced reduced Haitian demand. The 22 TEU of containerized rice from the US indicates that some shipments used container rather than bulk transport.</p>
<p>Pakistan, traditionally Haiti's second-largest rice supplier, experienced a significant decline with shipments falling 26.6% to 105 million kilograms. Pakistani rice market share dropped to 21.9%, indicating that reduced demand affected multiple suppliers rather than representing sourcing substitution. The 73 shipments from Pakistan throughout 2025 suggest continued regular trade relationships despite volume reductions.</p>
<p>India emerged as a growing rice supplier, with imports increasing 47.2% to 21 million kilograms. While still representing only 4.4% of Haiti's rice market, Indian suppliers demonstrated ability to gain market share even as overall demand declined. This growth suggests that Indian rice offered competitive advantages in pricing or product characteristics.</p>
<p>Suriname entered Haiti's rice market for the first time with 4.2 million kilograms, representing 0.9% market share. This new supplier relationship indicates Haiti's willingness to explore diverse sourcing options and suggests that South American suppliers found opportunities in the evolving Haitian market. Suriname's entry coincided with Guyana's dramatic decline from 6.2 million kilograms to just 989,000 kilograms, suggesting possible supplier substitution within the South American sourcing region.</p>
<p>The most dramatic food security story emerged in wheat imports, which exploded 135.2% to reach 221 million kilograms—all supplied by the United States. This massive increase elevated wheat to become Haiti's fifth-largest import by volume, indicating a fundamental shift in Haiti's grain consumption patterns. The 43 shipments of US wheat suggest systematic supply relationships rather than emergency purchases.</p>
<p>The wheat surge occurred entirely through US suppliers, with 47 TEU of containerized shipments complementing bulk deliveries. This growth pattern suggests that US agricultural exporters successfully developed new market opportunities in Haiti, potentially through competitive pricing or targeted marketing efforts. The scale of wheat import growth—from 94 million kilograms to 221 million kilograms—represents substantial market development.</p>
<p>The shift from rice toward wheat may reflect multiple factors including relative pricing, availability, consumer preference changes, or food program modifications. Wheat's advantages in storage, transportation, and processing could make it attractive for Haiti's food security programs. Additionally, US wheat's competitive positioning may have offered economic advantages over traditional rice sources.</p>
<p>Agricultural import patterns also revealed the continued importance of regional Caribbean suppliers. The Dominican Republic maintained significant agricultural trade relationships with Haiti, though specific commodity patterns shifted throughout 2025. Regional sourcing provides advantages in transportation costs, supply security, and trade relationship stability.</p>
<p>The overall pattern of declining rice imports combined with surging wheat imports suggests that Haiti's food security strategy evolved significantly during 2025. Rather than relying primarily on rice-based nutrition programs, Haiti appears to have diversified toward wheat-based alternatives that may offer economic or nutritional advantages.</p>
<p>Monthly patterns in agricultural imports showed relatively consistent volumes throughout 2025, suggesting that food security procurement had stabilized compared to the irregular patterns that characterized crisis periods. The regularity of shipments from major suppliers indicates that normal commercial relationships had resumed in agricultural commodities.</p>
<p>The agricultural import data reveals Haiti's food security challenges and opportunities. By successfully diversifying grain sources and developing new supplier relationships, Haiti demonstrated resilience and strategic thinking in managing food supply chains. The substantial volumes involved—nearly 700 million kilograms of rice and wheat combined—represent critical nutritional resources for Haiti's population.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>Part VI: Infrastructure Rebuilding</h2>
<p>Haiti's infrastructure rebuilding efforts became visible through dramatic increases in construction material and base metal imports, with the entire "Base Metals and Articles of Base Metal" section surging 295.5% to reach 118 million kilograms. This extraordinary growth reflects the scale and urgency of Haiti's reconstruction priorities throughout 2025.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic emerged as the dominant story in structural steel imports, with iron and steel structure imports (HS 7308) jumping from near-zero levels to 15.7 million kilograms. This massive increase represents entirely new trade relationships focused on construction materials, suggesting that major infrastructure projects required substantial steel framework components. The 47 shipments from the Dominican Republic indicate systematic supply relationships rather than isolated transactions.</p>
<p>Steel construction materials experienced remarkable growth across multiple categories. Iron or non-alloy steel angles, shapes, and sections (HS 7216) surged by over 108 million percent to reach 1.1 million kilograms, while stainless steel flat-rolled products (HS 7220) increased by 619 million percent to 619,000 kilograms. These astronomical percentage increases reflect growth from near-zero baselines, indicating that specialized steel products were virtually absent from Haiti's imports in 2024 but became significant in 2025.</p>
<p>Aluminum structures (HS 7610) demonstrated similar explosive growth, increasing by over 512 million percent to reach 512,000 kilograms. This surge in aluminum construction materials suggests that Haiti's rebuilding efforts incorporated modern construction techniques and materials. Aluminum's advantages in weight, corrosion resistance, and durability make it particularly valuable for Caribbean construction environments.</p>
