<strong>Haiti's Meat Imports from US More Than Double in 2025</strong>
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Haiti's imports of US meat and edible offal surged dramatically in 2025, with year-to-date volumes reaching 55.9 million kilograms compared to 26.6 million kilograms in the prior year—representing a substantial 110.4% increase. This growth underscores Haiti's persistent dependency on foreign protein sources to meet domestic consumption needs.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
Despite the impressive growth rate, meat and edible offal imports from the United States account for 1.4% of Haiti's total import portfolio by weight, reflecting the country's diversified import requirements across multiple commodity categories. The BOL-level customs data reveals significant increases across key logistics metrics, including container shipments and TEU volumes, indicating robust trade flow expansion.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The dramatic uptick in US meat imports likely stems from Haiti's limited domestic livestock production capacity, which has been constrained by ongoing agricultural challenges including inadequate infrastructure, limited feed availability, and economic pressures facing local farmers. Haiti's heavy reliance on food imports has been a persistent characteristic of its trade profile, with the country importing substantial quantities of basic foodstuffs to supplement domestic production.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
The United States has historically maintained its position as Haiti's primary trading partner for agricultural commodities, benefiting from established logistics networks and proximity advantages. The 2025 import surge may also reflect improved distribution channels and trade facilitation measures that have enhanced the efficiency of US-Haiti agricultural trade corridors.
</p>
<p class="story-para">
This import growth pattern aligns with Haiti's broader food security strategy, which continues to depend heavily on international markets to satisfy domestic protein demand across the population.
