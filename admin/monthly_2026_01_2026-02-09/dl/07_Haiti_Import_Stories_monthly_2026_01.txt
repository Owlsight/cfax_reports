*YoY +2218.8% | YTD 83.7k kg | Share 0.0% | Source: Anomaly Detection*

**Context:** The extraordinary 2,218% growth in unspecified commodities from Japan to Haiti in January 2026 likely reflects a new trade relationship or sourcing arrangement, possibly related to reconstruction materials, vehicles, or manufactured goods following Haiti's ongoing infrastructure needs. This surge could also indicate a statistical anomaly from a very low baseline in the previous year, as Haiti's import patterns have been highly volatile due to political instability and economic disruptions that have affected traditional supply chains from closer partners like the Dominican Republic and the United States.

**Haiti Records Dramatic Surge in Imports from Japan**

Haiti's imports of unspecified commodities from Japan experienced extraordinary growth in January 2026, with shipment volumes reaching 83,700 kilograms compared to just 3,600 kilograms in the same period last year—representing a remarkable 2,218% year-over-year increase.

This dramatic surge suggests the emergence of a new trade relationship between Haiti and Japan, though the commodities remain classified under the general HS code 9999 category. Despite the substantial percentage growth, these imports still represent a minimal share of Haiti's total import volume, reflecting the country's continued reliance on traditional trading partners in the region.

The massive increase likely stems from Haiti's ongoing infrastructure reconstruction needs, potentially involving Japanese-manufactured goods, machinery, or materials suited for development projects. Japan's reputation for producing high-quality construction equipment, vehicles, and industrial materials aligns with Haiti's current priorities for rebuilding critical infrastructure.

However, the exceptional growth rate also reflects the statistical impact of an extremely low baseline from the previous year. Haiti's import patterns have remained highly volatile due to persistent political instability and economic challenges that have disrupted established supply chains, particularly with closer partners like the Dominican Republic and the United States.

The customs data, compiled from bill-of-lading level records tracking weight, container units, and shipments, indicates this could represent either a significant one-time procurement or the beginning of a more sustained trade relationship as Haiti seeks to diversify its import sources amid ongoing domestic challenges.

**Context:** The dramatic 93.5% decline in Haiti's palm oil imports from Indonesia likely reflects the country's severe economic and political instability, which has significantly reduced purchasing power and disrupted import financing capabilities. Haiti's ongoing crisis has led to widespread business closures and reduced demand for cooking oils in the commercial food sector, while currency devaluation has made Indonesian palm oil imports prohibitively expensive. The decline may also indicate sourcing shifts toward cheaper regional suppliers or increased reliance on food aid programs that typically source from different origins than commercial imports.

**Haiti's Palm Oil Imports from Indonesia Plummet by 93.5%**

Haiti's palm oil imports from Indonesia experienced a dramatic collapse in early 2026, with shipments totaling just 5.3 million kilograms compared to 82.3 million kilograms in the prior year period. This represents a staggering 93.5% year-over-year decline, reducing Indonesia's share of Haiti's total palm oil imports to merely 1.3%.

The sharp contraction reflects Haiti's deepening economic and political crisis, which has severely constrained the country's import capacity. Widespread business closures and reduced commercial food sector activity have significantly diminished demand for cooking oils, while the continued devaluation of the Haitian gourde has made Indonesian palm oil imports prohibitively expensive for local importers.

BOL-level customs data reveals the extent of the disruption, with substantial reductions in shipment volumes, container counts, and TEU measurements across all metrics. The decline suggests that Haitian importers have either suspended operations entirely or shifted sourcing strategies toward more affordable regional suppliers.

Haiti's ongoing crisis has fundamentally altered the country's import patterns, with traditional commercial relationships giving way to emergency procurement and increased reliance on humanitarian food assistance programs. These aid channels typically source palm oil from different origins than commercial imports, further explaining Indonesia's reduced market presence.

The data underscores how political instability and economic collapse can rapidly transform established trade relationships. Unless Haiti's situation stabilizes and import financing mechanisms improve, Indonesian palm oil suppliers are likely to face continued challenges in this historically important Caribbean market.
