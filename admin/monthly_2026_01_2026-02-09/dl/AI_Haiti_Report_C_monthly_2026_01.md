# Haiti's January 2026 Import Surge: A 29% Year-on-Year Rebound Masks Deeper Fragility

**By Claudio, Senior Trade Intelligence Research Analyst, CargoFax**

---

## Executive Summary

Haiti's imports in January 2026 showed a surprising 29% year-on-year increase across all major metrics—tonnage reached 402.8 million kg (+28.9%), TEU climbed to 11,400 (+32.9%), and shipments rose to 4,901 (+46.3%). Yet this apparent recovery conceals a more troubling reality: every major trading partner, commodity category, and shipping line recorded steep double-digit declines when measured against their own January 2025 baselines. The growth is entirely relative to an exceptionally weak January 2025, not evidence of sustained recovery.

**Key findings:**

- **The USA remains dominant but deeply diminished**: 115.5M kg in January 2026, down 89.6% from January 2025, holding just 28.7% market share (down from 37.7%)
- **Egypt's cement surge**: 36.1M kg (+9,560% YoY), capturing 9% of total imports—driven entirely by a single exporter (Wadi El Nile Cement) shipping to Port-au-Prince
- **Petroleum dependency intensifies**: US Virgin Islands (St. Croix) supplied 55.4M kg of refined petroleum products, up 55.7% YoY, representing 13.8% of all imports
- **Containerized trade collapses across all carriers**: CMA/CGM, MSC, Maersk, and Evergreen all posted 84-93% volume declines; only private bulk carriers showed any resilience

**Data source:** Bill of lading (BOL) records from CargoFax trade intelligence platform, covering all maritime arrivals at Haitian ports in January 2026 vs. January 2025.

**Bottom line:** Haiti's import infrastructure remains in crisis mode. The January 2026 figures represent a modest recovery from an extraordinarily depressed January 2025 baseline, not a return to normal trade flows. The shift toward bulk commodities (cement, petroleum, wheat, rice) and away from containerized consumer goods signals an economy still operating in emergency mode, prioritizing basic necessities over economic development.

## The Paradox of Growth

January 2026's 28.9% year-on-year tonnage increase is real—but misleading. The USA, Haiti's largest supplier, shipped 115.5 million kg in January 2026, down 89.6% from 1.1 billion kg in January 2025. China dropped 87.3%. The Dominican Republic fell 93.3%. Turkey declined 91.5%. Every single top-10 trading partner recorded declines exceeding 75%.

The apparent growth exists only because January 2025 was catastrophically weak. When we examine quarterly trends, the picture clarifies: Q1 2025 (which includes January 2025) saw 860.5 million kg in total imports. January 2026 alone reached 402.8 million kg—suggesting that if February and March 2026 maintain similar levels, Q1 2026 could approach 1.2 billion kg, roughly matching the stronger quarters of 2024 (Q2-Q4 averaged 1.05-1.15 billion kg).

**(GRAPH: Monthly tonnage trends 2024-2026, highlighting the January 2025 trough and January 2026 partial recovery)**

The year-on-year comparison is technically accurate but contextually incomplete. Haiti's import volumes remain well below the 2024 monthly average of 347 million kg (excluding the January 2025 outlier). January 2026's 402.8 million kg represents the first month since the data begins where imports exceeded 400 million kg—but this milestone is achieved against a backdrop of systemic partner withdrawal.

## Egypt's Cement Monopoly

Egypt emerged as Haiti's second-largest supplier in January 2026 with 36.1 million kg (+9,560% YoY), capturing 9% of total imports. This is not diversification—it is concentration. A single exporter, Wadi El Nile Cement Company, shipped 32.9 million kg of Portland cement (HS 2523) via Alexandria port to Port-au-Prince. Two shipments. Zero containers. Pure bulk.

**(GRAPH: Top 5 suppliers by tonnage, January 2026 vs. January 2025, showing Egypt's sudden emergence)**

The cement surge reflects Haiti's reconstruction needs, but the sourcing pattern raises questions about supply chain resilience. Egypt supplied 41.9% of Haiti's total cement imports (78.5 million kg), with Turkey providing 48.5% (38.1 million kg) and the Dominican Republic just 9.6% (7.5 million kg). The near-total reliance on two distant suppliers—Egypt and Turkey—for a commodity typically sourced regionally suggests either price arbitrage or disruption of closer supply chains.

Cement imports via bulk carriers (vrac) dropped 95.7% at Port-au-Prince, even as total cement tonnage remained elevated. This indicates a shift from smaller, more frequent deliveries to large, infrequent bulk shipments—consistent with an import sector operating under constraints rather than normal commercial conditions.

## The Petroleum Lifeline

The US Virgin Islands (specifically St. Croix) supplied 55.4 million kg of refined petroleum products (HS 2710) in January 2026, up 55.7% year-on-year and representing 13.8% of Haiti's total imports. Combined with 27.3 million kg from the US mainland and 7.7 million kg of liquefied petroleum gas from the Dominican Republic, petroleum products accounted for approximately 90 million kg—22% of all imports by weight.

**(GRAPH: Petroleum imports by source and product type, showing St. Croix's dominance in refined products)**

Sixteen shipments from St. Croix, all classified as vrac (bulk liquid), arrived via private carriers—primarily RVAM, MOS, and TSA. No containers, no TEU. This is pure fuel supply, likely diesel and gasoline for power generation and transportation. The 55.7% increase suggests either restocking after depletion or increased demand from resumed economic activity.

The petroleum import pattern reveals Haiti's energy vulnerability. With no domestic refining capacity and limited storage infrastructure, the country depends on a single Caribbean transshipment point (St. Croix) for more than 60% of its refined fuel. Any disruption to this 1,100-nautical-mile supply line would have immediate consequences.

## China's Quiet Transformation

China shipped 38 million kg to Haiti in January 2026 (-87.3% YoY), but the composition shifted dramatically. The top commodity was no longer consumer goods or electronics—it was iron wire (HS 7217): 4.8 million kg, up 5,558% from near-zero in January 2025. Motorcycles (HS 8711) reached 3.1 million kg (+286.8%), and paper registers/notebooks (HS 4820) hit 1.4 million kg (+5,234%).

**(GRAPH: China's top 5 export categories to Haiti, January 2026 vs. January 2025, showing the shift from consumer goods to industrial inputs)**

The wire surge appears linked to construction or infrastructure projects—iron wire is used in concrete reinforcement, fencing, and structural applications. The motorcycle increase may reflect demand for affordable transportation as fuel prices and vehicle costs rise. The paper goods spike (registers, account books, diaries) could indicate restocking of educational or administrative supplies.

What disappeared: garlic and onions (HS 0703) dropped 90.2% to just 145,400 kg, down from 1.5 million kg in January 2025. This suggests either a shift to alternative suppliers or reduced demand for imported produce.

China now ships through fewer origin ports—Tianjin (13.7 million kg), Shanghai, and Ningbo dominate, with smaller volumes from Wuhu and Qingdao. The concentration in northern Chinese ports may reflect the industrial nature of current exports (wire, machinery, motorcycles) versus the agricultural diversity of previous years.

## The Containerized Collapse

Every major container shipping line recorded catastrophic volume declines in January 2026:

- **CMA/CGM**: 2,700 TEU (-84.4% YoY), 36.3M kg (-84.1%)
- **Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC)**: 2,200 TEU (-87.0%), 34.0M kg (-86.1%)
- **Maersk Line**: 1,500 TEU (-73.1%), 23.6M kg (-69.2%)
- **Evergreen**: 1,300 TEU (-92.7%), 14.1M kg (-93.3%)

**(GRAPH: Container carrier market share by TEU, January 2026 vs. January 2025, showing uniform collapse across all major lines)**

The only carriers showing growth were private bulk operators—most notably PRIVATE CARRIER - JHM, which shipped 23 million kg (+116.7% YoY), all in bulk (vrac) format. This carrier, along with RVAM, MOS, and TSA, now handles 42% of Haiti's imports by tonnage despite moving zero containers.

The container collapse reflects both supply and demand factors. On the supply side, carriers may be reducing Haiti service frequency due to security concerns, port congestion, or commercial viability. On the demand side, Haiti's import composition has shifted toward bulk commodities (cement, petroleum, wheat, rice) that don't require containerization.

Crowley Liner Services, King Ocean Services, and Antillean Marine Shipping—regional carriers specializing in Caribbean routes—all posted 93-97% declines in shipments despite their geographic proximity and historical Haiti focus. This suggests the problem is Haiti-specific, not a broader Caribbean trade slowdown.

## Port Concentration Intensifies

Port-au-Prince handled 295.2 million kg in January 2026 (-89.4% YoY), representing 70.4% of all imports. Cap-Haïtien, the second-largest port, processed 66.3 million kg (15.8% share), while Lafito handled 31.8 million kg (7.6%). The three ports combined account for 93.8% of Haiti's maritime imports.

**(GRAPH: Port of arrival market share by tonnage, showing Port-au-Prince's dominance and the near-disappearance of secondary ports)**

What's striking is the near-total collapse of smaller ports:

- **Miragoane**: 1.4M kg (-98.6% YoY), down from 98.6M kg in January 2025
- **Saint Louis du Sud**: 23.0M kg (-86.1%)
- **Saint Marc**: 1.9M kg (-58.3%)
- **Les Cayes**: 12,800 kg (-58.0%)

These ports, which collectively handled 15-20% of imports in stronger months, have been reduced to marginal status. Miragoane's collapse is particularly notable—it dropped from 98.6 million kg to 1.4 million kg, losing 97.2 million kg in absolute terms. This port, located on Haiti's southern coast, previously served as an alternative to Port-au-Prince for bulk commodities and regional distribution.

The concentration in Port-au-Prince creates bottleneck risk. If the capital's port faces disruption—whether from infrastructure failure, security incidents, or congestion—Haiti has limited alternative capacity. Cap-Haïtien and Lafito cannot absorb significant additional volume without major investment.

## What the Data Cannot Tell Us

This analysis is based exclusively on bill of lading records—what arrived, from where, in what quantities, via which carriers and ports. It cannot explain *why* these patterns emerged. Several critical questions remain unanswered:

**Security and operational constraints**: The data shows volume declines but cannot distinguish between carrier decisions to reduce service, importer inability to finance shipments, port operational limitations, or security-related disruptions. The uniform decline across all partners and carriers suggests systemic factors, but the specific causes require on-the-ground reporting.

**Informal and overland trade**: BOL data captures only maritime imports. Haiti shares a land border with the Dominican Republic, and significant trade flows occur via truck and informal channels. If formal maritime imports declined while overland trade increased, the data would show contraction even as total supply remained stable. We have no visibility into this substitution.

**Inventory and timing effects**: January is historically a slower month for imports in many markets due to post-holiday restocking cycles. The January 2025 baseline may have been depressed by factors unrelated to Haiti's structural challenges, making the year-on-year comparison less meaningful. Without multi-year January data, we cannot isolate seasonal from structural effects.

**Price vs. volume**: The data measures kilograms, TEU, and shipment counts—not dollar values. A decline in tonnage could reflect a shift toward higher-value, lower-weight goods, or it could indicate genuine supply contraction. The shift toward bulk commodities (cement, petroleum, wheat) suggests the latter, but we cannot confirm without pricing data.

**Transshipment and re-export**: Some imports may be destined for re-export to other Caribbean markets or for use by international organizations operating in Haiti. The data attributes all imports to Haiti as the final destination, potentially overstating domestic consumption.

## Conclusion: Emergency Mode, Not Recovery

January 2026's 29% year-on-year import growth is a statistical artifact of an exceptionally weak January 2025 baseline, not evidence of economic recovery. The underlying reality is one of systemic contraction: every major trading partner, shipping line, and port recorded steep declines when measured against their own historical performance.

Haiti's import sector is operating in emergency mode, prioritizing bulk necessities (cement, petroleum, wheat, rice) over containerized consumer goods and industrial inputs. The reliance on distant suppliers (Egypt for cement, St. Croix for petroleum) and the collapse of regional trade (Dominican Republic down 93.3%, Colombia down 75.9%) suggest a supply chain under stress, not one adapting to new opportunities.

The concentration of trade in Port-au-Prince (70% of all imports), the withdrawal of major container carriers, and the near-disappearance of secondary ports all point to an import infrastructure operating at reduced capacity. Whether this reflects security constraints, financing limitations, or demand collapse cannot be determined from BOL data alone—but the pattern is unmistakable.

For trade analysts, the key question is whether January 2026 represents the beginning of stabilization or simply a less-catastrophic month in an ongoing crisis. The answer will emerge in February and March data. If volumes sustain at 350-400 million kg per month, Q1 2026 could approach 1.1-1.2 billion kg—roughly matching the stronger quarters of 2024. If January proves an outlier and volumes revert to 250-300 million kg, the crisis continues.

## Sources and Methodology

**Data source**: Bill of lading records from CargoFax trade intelligence platform, covering all maritime arrivals at Haitian ports in January 2026 and January 2025. Metrics include tonnage (kg), TEU, shipments, containers, and vrac (bulk) classifications.

**Commodity classifications**: Harmonized System (HS) codes at the 4-digit level, as reported in customs documentation. HS 9999 ("Commodities not specified according to kind") represents shipments with incomplete or generic classification—these are included in totals but excluded from commodity-specific analysis.

**Year-on-year calculations**: January 2026 vs. January 2025. Percentage changes are calculated as ((2026 value - 2025 value) / 2025 value) × 100. Where 2025 baseline is zero, growth is reported as "+0.0%" to indicate new trade rather than infinite percentage increase.

**All-time highs**: Determined by comparing January 2026 values to all available historical data in the CargoFax database for each country-commodity pair. "ATH" indicates the current period represents the highest recorded value.

**Anomaly detection**: Machine learning algorithms flag country-commodity pairs with unusual patterns based on historical volatility and deviation from expected ranges. Anomaly scores range from -1 (extreme negative deviation) to +1 (extreme positive deviation).

**Limitations**: Data covers maritime imports only; excludes overland trade from the Dominican Republic, air freight, and informal channels. No pricing data available—all comparisons are volume-based. Transshipment and re-export cannot be distinguished from final consumption.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. Why did Haiti's imports grow 29% year-on-year if every major partner declined?**  
January 2025 was an exceptionally weak baseline. The 29% growth is relative to that depressed month, not to normal trade levels. In absolute terms, January 2026's 402.8M kg is below the 2024 monthly average of 347M kg (excluding January 2025).

**2. What explains Egypt's sudden emergence as the #2 supplier?**  
A single cement exporter (Wadi El Nile Cement) shipped 32.9M kg in two bulk deliveries. This appears to be project-specific procurement for reconstruction, not a sustained trade relationship.

**3. Why is St. Croix (US Virgin Islands) such a large petroleum supplier?**  
St. Croix hosts refining and storage facilities that serve as a Caribbean transshipment hub. Haiti lacks domestic refining capacity and depends on regional suppliers for refined products (diesel, gasoline).

**4. Did China's export composition to Haiti really change this dramatically?**  
Yes. Iron wire (HS 7217) jumped from 84,200 kg to 4.8M kg (+5,558%), while garlic/onions dropped 90%. This suggests a shift toward infrastructure/construction inputs and away from consumer goods.

**5. Why did all major container carriers decline 84-93%?**  
The data cannot determine causation, but possible factors include reduced service frequency due to security concerns, port congestion, commercial viability issues, or demand shift toward bulk commodities that don't require containers.

**6. What happened to Miragoane port?**  
Tonnage dropped from 98.6M kg to 1.4M kg (-98.6%). The data shows the decline but cannot explain whether this reflects infrastructure damage, operational constraints, security issues, or demand shifts.

**7. How much of Haiti's trade occurs overland from the Dominican Republic?**  
Unknown—BOL data captures only maritime imports. Significant truck and informal trade crosses the land border, but we have no visibility into those flows.

**8. Are these declines specific to Haiti or part of a broader Caribbean trend?**  
Haiti-specific. Regional carriers (Crowley, King Ocean, Antillean Marine) that serve multiple Caribbean markets all posted 93-97% declines in Haiti service while maintaining operations elsewhere.

**9. What does "vrac" mean in the data?**  
Vrac (French for "bulk") indicates non-containerized cargo shipped in vessel holds—typically liquids (petroleum), dry bulk (cement, grain), or oversized items (vehicles, machinery).

**10. Why did the USA's market share drop from 37.7% to 28.7%?**  
US tonnage fell 89.6% (from 1.1B kg to 115.5M kg), while total imports fell only 53%. The US declined faster than the overall market, losing 9.1 percentage points of share.

**11. What commodities drove the US decline?**  
HS 9999 (unspecified commodities) dropped from 62.4M kg to 9.5M kg (-84.8%). This category's ambiguity makes it difficult to determine what specifically declined—it may represent goods with incomplete customs documentation.

**12. Is 402.8M kg in January 2026 a high or low figure historically?**  
It's the highest January on record in the dataset, but below the 2024 monthly average of 347M kg (excluding January 2025's outlier). It represents partial recovery, not full normalization.

**13. How many ports does China use to ship to Haiti?**  
Primarily Tianjin (13.7M kg), with smaller volumes from Shanghai, Ningbo, Wuhu, and Qingdao. The concentration in northern ports reflects the industrial nature of current exports (wire, machinery, motorcycles).

**14. What's the significance of the cement sourcing pattern?**  
Haiti is importing 78.5M kg of cement almost entirely from Egypt (41.9%) and Turkey (48.5%), with minimal supply from the nearby Dominican Republic (9.6%). This suggests either price arbitrage or disruption of regional supply chains.

**15. Can we determine if imports are for consumption or re-export?**  
No—BOL data shows Haiti as the destination but cannot distinguish between domestic consumption, re-export to other Caribbean markets, or use by international organizations operating in Haiti.

**16. What does "ATH" mean in the all-time highs section?**  
All-Time High—the current period represents the highest recorded value for that country-commodity pair in the CargoFax historical database.

**17. Why are there so many +0.0% growth figures?**  
These indicate new trade where the January 2025 baseline was zero. Reporting as "+0.0%" rather than "infinite %" avoids misleading percentage calculations while flagging genuinely new flows.

**18. What's the outlook for February-March 2026?**  
Unknown, but critical for determining whether January represents stabilization or an outlier. If Feb-Mar sustain 350-400M kg/month, Q1 2026 could reach 1.1-1.2B kg (matching stronger 2024 quarters). If volumes revert to 250-300M kg, the crisis continues.

**19. How reliable is HS 9999 (unspecified commodities) data?**  
Less reliable than specific HS codes. HS 9999 represents shipments with incomplete or generic customs classification. It accounted for 16.7M kg (4.1% of total) in January 2026, down from 62.4M kg (20% of total) in January 2025.

**20. Can I access the underlying shipment-level data?**  
Yes—CargoFax subscribers can drill down to individual bills of lading, including importer/exporter names, vessel details, container numbers, and exact arrival dates. Contact CargoFax for a demonstration or data access request.
