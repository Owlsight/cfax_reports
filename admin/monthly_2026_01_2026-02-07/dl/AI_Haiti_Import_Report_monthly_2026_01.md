## Part I: The January Reality — A Trade Landscape Under Pressure

January 2026 tells the story of a trade relationship under extraordinary strain. Haiti's import volumes reached 402.8 million kilograms for the month—a figure that would have represented a typical week's worth of commerce in more stable periods, but in this context reflects the essential goods that continued flowing despite broader disruptions.

The 28.9% year-over-year increase in January volumes, while seemingly positive, masks a more complex reality. This growth occurred against dramatically reduced baselines, with February through December 2025 showing complete data gaps that suggest significant trade disruption throughout the latter part of the previous year. The 32.9% increase in TEU capacity to 11,400 containers indicates that whatever goods did arrive came through more efficient containerized logistics rather than traditional bulk shipping methods.

The monthly data reveals the stark reality: while January 2026 recorded substantial import activity, the complete absence of data for subsequent months suggests this may represent a brief window of accessible trade rather than sustained recovery. The 4,901 individual shipments arriving in January—a 46.3% increase from the prior year—point to smaller, more frequent deliveries replacing the large-scale bulk operations that historically characterized Haiti's import trade.

## Part II: Essential Commodities — Survival Trade Patterns

The top five commodities by combined weight, container volume, and shipment frequency paint a picture of survival-focused trade. Petroleum products led all categories with 82.9 million kilograms, followed by Portland cement at 78.5 million kg, rice at 42.3 million kg, wheat at 27.3 million kg, and sugar at 26.4 million kg. These commodities—energy, construction materials, and basic foodstuffs—represent the fundamental requirements for maintaining basic economic and social functions.

Petroleum imports (HS 2710) arrived through 58 individual shipments totaling 110 TEU, suggesting smaller, more frequent fuel deliveries rather than large tanker operations. The US Virgin Islands supplied 66.8% of Haiti's petroleum needs with 55.4 million kg, while the United States provided another 32.9% with 27.3 million kg. This geographic concentration reflects the critical importance of nearby suppliers when traditional supply chains face disruption.

Portland cement imports (HS 2523) demonstrate the continued need for construction materials despite challenging conditions. Turkey emerged as the dominant supplier with 38.1 million kg representing 48.5% of cement imports, followed by Egypt with 33.0 million kg and the Dominican Republic contributing 7.5 million kg. The minimal containerization of cement—just one TEU across five shipments—indicates these arrived as bulk cargo through specialized handling facilities.

Rice imports from the United States totaled 30.6 million kg across six shipments, representing 72.2% of Haiti's total rice supply. Pakistan contributed 6.5 million kg (15.3% share) while India provided 4.2 million kg. The concentration of rice sourcing in American suppliers reflects both geographic proximity and established agricultural trade relationships that proved resilient during difficult periods.

## Part III: Country Dynamics — Geographic Patterns of Essential Trade

The United States maintained its position as Haiti's primary trade partner with 115.5 million kg of imports across 2,423 individual shipments. American exports to Haiti included rice (30.6M kg), petroleum products (27.3M kg), wheat (27.3M kg), and a substantial volume of unspecified commodities (9.5M kg) that likely represent diverse manufactured goods or emergency supplies.

The US Virgin Islands emerged as the second-largest supplier by weight with 55.4 million kg, though this volume arrived in just 16 shipments—indicating very large petroleum deliveries that supported Haiti's energy needs. The territory's role as a petroleum hub for the Caribbean proved crucial in maintaining fuel supplies during challenging periods.

Turkey's position as the third-largest supplier reflects its specialization in cement exports, with 38.1 million kg representing nearly all of its trade with Haiti. This focused commodity relationship demonstrates how specific industrial partnerships continued functioning even when broader trade relationships faced stress.

China maintained its presence with 38.0 million kg across 1,027 shipments totaling 3,049 TEU—the highest container count among all suppliers. This pattern suggests Chinese exports consisted primarily of manufactured goods requiring containerized transport, contrasting with the bulk commodity focus of other major suppliers.

Egypt's cement exports totaled 36.1 million kg, arriving in a single massive shipment that demonstrates the efficiency of dedicated bulk carriers for construction materials. The concentration of Egypt's trade in cement reflects established supplier relationships in building materials that remained operational during the challenging period.

## Part IV: Emergency Flows and Anomalous Patterns

Machine learning analysis identified several unusual trade patterns that reveal adaptive responses to challenging conditions. Japan's exports of unspecified commodities (HS 9999) totaled 84,000 kg—a 2,218% year-over-year increase that earned the highest anomaly score in the dataset. This dramatic surge likely represents humanitarian assistance or emergency supplies, as Japan has historically provided rapid crisis response to Caribbean nations.

India's exports of vegetable-based coloring matter (HS 3203) reached levels that triggered statistical anomaly flags, suggesting either emergency pharmaceutical supplies or industrial inputs for essential manufacturing. The Netherlands appeared in anomaly detection for medical instruments (HS 9018), potentially indicating emergency healthcare equipment shipments.

The concentration of anomalous flows in categories like unspecified commodities, medical supplies, and emergency materials suggests that traditional commercial relationships gave way to crisis-response logistics during this period. These patterns reflect the adaptation of international supply chains to prioritize humanitarian and essential needs over routine commercial transactions.

## Part V: Logistics and Infrastructure Adaptations

The dramatic improvement in containerization efficiency—32.9% more TEU carrying 28.9% more cargo—reveals significant adaptations in logistics operations. The 11,400 containers that arrived in January represented more efficient packing and routing compared to historical patterns, suggesting that shipping lines optimized their operations for essential cargo movement.

The increase to 4,901 individual shipments (up 46.3% year-over-year) combined with higher container counts indicates a shift toward smaller, more frequent deliveries. This pattern typically emerges when large-scale logistics operations become impractical, forcing supply chains to adapt through more nimble but less economical delivery methods.

The 38.9% increase in total containers to 6,982 units, combined with the TEU growth, suggests that shipping lines deployed smaller containers or achieved better utilization rates. This adaptation likely reflected both security considerations and the practical challenges of managing large-scale operations during unstable periods.

## Part VI: Sectoral Analysis — Economic Priorities Revealed

Mineral products dominated Haiti's import portfolio with 43.8% share and 176.3 million kg, primarily consisting of petroleum and cement. This sector's 136.4% year-over-year growth reflects the critical importance of energy and construction materials for maintaining basic economic functions.

Vegetable products captured 18.7% of import volumes with 75.2 million kg, growing 46.8% year-over-year. This category, dominated by rice and wheat imports, demonstrates the continued priority placed on food security even during challenging periods.

Prepared foodstuffs maintained a 9.9% share with 40.0 million kg, though this sector contracted 7.0% year-over-year. The relative decline in processed foods compared to basic agricultural commodities suggests a shift toward fundamental nutrition over convenience products.

Chemical products showed remarkable 166.1% growth to 12.5 million kg, potentially reflecting increased demand for medical supplies, water treatment chemicals, or industrial inputs essential for basic services. This growth pattern, combined with the anomalous flows detected in pharmaceutical categories, suggests emergency procurement of essential chemical supplies.

Base metals and metal articles grew 61.9% to 13.0 million kg, likely reflecting continued demand for construction materials, repair supplies, and essential infrastructure components. The strong growth in this sector indicates ongoing efforts to maintain and repair critical infrastructure despite broader challenges.

## Conclusion: Adaptation in Crisis

January 2026 represents a snapshot of trade relationships under extraordinary pressure, revealing both the resilience and vulnerability of Haiti's import dependencies. The data shows an economy that successfully maintained access to essential commodities—energy, food, construction materials, and emergency supplies—while traditional commercial relationships adapted to challenging operating conditions.

The emergence of emergency flows, particularly from Japan and other nations with histories of humanitarian assistance, demonstrates the international community's continued engagement with Haiti during difficult periods. The shift toward smaller, more frequent shipments and improved containerization efficiency reveals supply chain adaptations that prioritized reliability over cost optimization.

The concentration of imports in fundamental categories—petroleum, cement, rice, wheat, and sugar—reflects an economy focused on survival rather than growth. Yet the successful delivery of over 400 million kg of essential goods through nearly 5,000 individual shipments demonstrates the remarkable persistence of international trade relationships even under adverse conditions.

The complete absence of data for subsequent months in 2026 suggests that January may have represented either a brief window of accessibility or the last recorded period before more significant disruptions. Regardless, the month reveals the critical importance of nearby suppliers, particularly the United States and US Virgin Islands, in maintaining Haiti's access to essential commodities when traditional supply chains face stress.
