# Haiti 2025: The China Surge, the Cement Scramble, and the Curious Case of Disappearing Buses

**CargoFax Trade Intelligence | Annual 2025 Report**

---

## Executive Summary

Haiti's import landscape in 2025 tells a story of structural realignment. While total tonnage grew a modest **4.3% to 4.09 billion kg**, the containerized segment exploded—**TEU volumes jumped 29.5%** to 101,500 units, signaling a fundamental shift in how goods reach the island.

**Key findings:**

- **China's market share surge**: Container share climbed from 19.9% to 25.2% (+5.4 percentage points), the largest single-country gain across all metrics
- **The cement supplier scramble**: Vietnam, Dominican Republic, and Panama collectively added 270 million kg of cement capacity as Haiti diversified away from traditional sources
- **U.S. bus imports collapsed 94%**: From 147.5M kg to 8.6M kg—a $100M+ category that effectively vanished
- **Port Everglades became Haiti's shipment hub**: 9,700 shipments (+95.5% YoY), now handling 22.4% of all Haiti-bound cargo movements

## 1. China's Quiet Takeover of Haiti's Container Trade

The headline number—China's tonnage up 83% to 312 million kg—understates the transformation. Look at the containerized metrics:

| Metric | 2024 | 2025 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| TEU | 16.2K | 27.1K | **+67.1%** |
| Containers | 8.7K | 14.8K | **+70.9%** |
| Shipments | 5.0K | 8.4K | **+66.5%** |

China now commands **26.7% of Haiti's TEU volume**—nearly tied with the USA at 27.1%. Two years ago, this gap was double digits.

What's driving it? The commodity breakdown reveals the answer:

- **Motorcycles (HS 8711)**: 12.8M kg (+197.8%), with China holding 79.8% of TEU share
- **Iron/steel bars (HS 7214)**: 19.8M kg (+11,560.7%)—from near-zero to Haiti's primary supplier
- **Mixed cargo (HS 9999)**: 55.7M kg (+103.7%), the catch-all category that often signals consumer goods

**(GRAPH: China vs. USA market share by metric, 2021-2025)**

The steel bar surge is particularly notable. China went from supplying 169,700 kg in 2024 to **19.8 million kg** in 2025—capturing 43.3% of the category. Turkey followed with 11.0M kg (+1,682%), while Hong Kong added 6.0M kg. This looks like coordinated infrastructure demand, possibly reconstruction-related.

## 2. The Great Cement Diversification

Haiti imported over **1 billion kg of cement** (HS 2523) in 2025, and the supplier map redrawn itself:

| Country | 2024 | 2025 | Change | Share |
|---------|------|------|--------|-------|
| Turkey | 461.4M kg | 449.9M kg | -2.5% | 42.7% |
| Egypt | 237.2M kg | 236.5M kg | -0.3% | 22.4% |
| Vietnam | 57.0M kg | **149.1M kg** | **+161.6%** | 14.2% |
| Dominican Republic | 14.9M kg | **117.2M kg** | **+686.5%** | 11.1% |
| Panama | 10.0M kg | **64.4M kg** | **+541.9%** | 6.1% |

Three new suppliers—Vietnam, Dominican Republic, and Panama—added **270 million kg** of cement capacity in a single year. Meanwhile, Colombia effectively exited: from 29.3M kg to just 24,200 kg (-99.9%).

**(GRAPH: Cement supplier share shift, 2024 vs. 2025)**

The USA also entered the cement market in force: from 67,600 kg to **36.1 million kg** (+53,247%). This is an all-time high for U.S. cement exports to Haiti.

What explains this scramble? The data suggests Haiti is actively de-risking its cement supply chain. Turkey and Egypt remain dominant but flat. The growth came entirely from regional and Asian alternatives.

## 3. The Bus Mystery: 147 Million Kg That Vanished

The single largest tonnage decline in the dataset:

**U.S. public transport vehicles (HS 8702)**: 147.5M kg → 8.6M kg (-94.2%)

This isn't a rounding error. The USA supplied 98% of this category, and it collapsed. At typical vehicle weights, this represents thousands of buses that simply weren't shipped.

The ML anomaly detection flagged this as one of the most significant outliers in the entire dataset. Possible explanations include:

1. **One-time fleet replacement completed in 2024** that won't recur
2. **Financing or regulatory changes** affecting vehicle imports
3. **Security conditions** making large vehicle deployments impractical

We cannot determine causation from BOL data alone, but the scale demands attention. This single category accounts for most of the USA's 6.5% tonnage decline.

## 4. The Port Everglades Phenomenon

Florida's Port Everglades emerged as Haiti's primary shipment gateway in 2025:

| Metric | 2024 | 2025 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Shipments | 4,963 | **9,700** | **+95.5%** |
| TEU | 9,001 | 12,800 | +42.2% |
| Vrac | 1,532 | **4,400** | **+187.1%** |

Port Everglades now handles **22.4% of all shipments** to Haiti—more than Miami (23.2% of shipments but lower growth). The vrac (bulk/breakbulk) surge is particularly striking: Port Everglades captured 35.2% of all vrac shipments to Haiti.

**(GRAPH: Port of origin share by shipment count)**

Meanwhile, tonnage through Port Everglades actually fell 49.9% to 221.8M kg. This divergence—more shipments, less weight—suggests a shift toward smaller, more frequent cargo movements rather than bulk commodity flows.

## 5. Carrier Realignment: Evergreen's Breakout Year

The container shipping market saw significant share shifts:

| Carrier | TEU 2024 | TEU 2025 | Change | Share |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| Evergreen | 9.8K | **18.3K** | **+87.4%** | 18.0% |
| MSC | 11.9K | 17.2K | +45.1% | 17.0% |
| CMA/CGM | 17.5K | 17.5K | -0.0% | 17.2% |
| ZIM Lines | 3.9K | 6.8K | +75.9% | 6.7% |

Evergreen nearly doubled its Haiti volumes, leapfrogging to become the largest carrier by TEU. The Taiwanese line's container count rose 81.7% to 10,400 units.

CMA/CGM, previously dominant, held flat—losing relative share as the market expanded. MSC grew strongly but couldn't match Evergreen's pace.

## 6. Secondary Port Activation

Haiti's smaller ports showed dramatic activity increases, though from low bases:

| Port | Shipments 2024 | Shipments 2025 | Change |
|------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| Les Cayes | 1 | **403** | +40,200% |
| Gonaïves | 1 | **323** | +32,200% |
| Miragoane | 1,888 | **4,400** | +133% |

Les Cayes and Gonaïves effectively went from dormant to active. These are vrac-dominated ports—Les Cayes handled 403 vrac shipments (100% of its traffic), Gonaïves 324.

This pattern suggests deliberate cargo routing away from congested primary ports, or possibly localized demand that previously went unmet.

## 7. All-Time Highs Worth Watching

The dataset flagged 20+ all-time highs. The most consequential:

- **U.S. wheat (HS 1001)**: 220.7M kg (+135.2%)—Haiti's largest single-commodity flow from the USA
- **U.S. poultry (HS 0207)**: 55.9M kg (+110.4%)—food security implications
- **Vietnam cement**: 149.1M kg—new supplier reaching scale
- **Belgian malt (HS 1107)**: 8.3M kg—beverage industry input
- **Chinese mixed cargo (HS 9999)**: 55.7M kg—consumer goods proxy

## Methodology Note

This analysis is based on bill of lading (BOL) data processed by CargoFax. All figures represent physical cargo movements (kg, TEU, containers, shipments, vrac) rather than declared values. Year-over-year comparisons use full calendar year 2024 as the baseline.

Percentage changes exceeding 1,000% typically reflect near-zero baselines in the prior period and should be interpreted as market entry rather than growth.
