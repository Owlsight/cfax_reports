## Part I: The Big Picture

Haiti's import trade in 2025 grew at a measured pace, with total tonnage reaching **4.09 billion kg**, up **4.3%** from 3.92 billion kg in 2024. This modest expansion belies more significant shifts in how goods arrived and from where they originated.

The most striking development was the acceleration in containerized trade. TEU volume climbed **29.5%** to **101,500 TEU** from 78,300 TEU the prior year—a growth rate nearly seven times faster than tonnage expansion. This divergence suggests Haiti's import mix is gradually shifting toward higher-value, containerized goods and away from bulk commodities that move in larger volumes per shipment.

*(GRAPH: Dual-axis chart showing tonnage (bars) and TEU (line) by month, 2024 vs 2025)*

Shipment counts reinforced this containerization trend. Total shipments reached **43,400**, up **32.5%** from the prior year, while container movements totaled **58,800**, rising **29.5%** year-over-year. The growth in shipment frequency outpacing tonnage growth indicates more frequent, smaller consignments—a pattern consistent with diversifying supply chains and potentially more fragmented ordering patterns.

Vrac (bulk/break-bulk) shipments presented a more nuanced picture. Total vrac movements reached **12,500**, up **11.6%** from 2024. While this growth rate lagged containerized metrics, it nonetheless represented continued demand for commodities that move outside standard container formats—primarily petroleum products, cement, and grains.

The quarterly pattern revealed meaningful seasonality. The first quarter saw tonnage decline **2.4%** year-over-year to 860.5 million kg, reflecting a slow start to the year. The second and third quarters then accelerated, with tonnage rising **14.2%** and **12.5%** respectively. The fourth quarter softened again, declining **4.6%** to 1.15 billion kg. TEU volumes, by contrast, grew in every quarter, with the third quarter posting the strongest expansion at **58.1%** year-over-year.

This macro picture—modest tonnage growth, accelerating containerization, and quarterly volatility—sets the stage for understanding the commodity and country dynamics that drove Haiti's 2025 import profile.

## Part II: Top Commodities

Haiti's import basket in 2025 remained concentrated in essential commodities: energy products, construction materials, and food staples. However, the relative weights shifted meaningfully, with several product categories posting notable gains or declines.

### Petroleum Products: The Dominant Category

Petroleum oils (HS 2710) represented the single largest commodity flow by tonnage, reaching **670.2 million kg**—approximately **16.4%** of Haiti's total imports. The U.S. Virgin Islands supplied the majority at 519.9 million kg, up **48.8%** from 2024, while the United States itself emerged as a significant new source, shipping 136.9 million kg compared to negligible volumes the prior year.

This shift in petroleum sourcing represents one of the year's most significant trade developments. The U.S. Virgin Islands' St. Croix refinery continued its role as Haiti's primary fuel supplier, but the emergence of direct U.S. mainland shipments—primarily from Houston and New Orleans—suggests either capacity constraints in the Virgin Islands or competitive pricing from Gulf Coast refineries.

Crude petroleum (HS 2709) flows also shifted dramatically. The Netherlands Antilles emerged as the dominant supplier at 28.9 million kg, up **363.9%** from 6.2 million kg in 2024, while U.S. Virgin Islands crude shipments collapsed **88.6%** to just 6.0 million kg. This substitution pattern warrants monitoring, as it may reflect changing refinery relationships or pricing dynamics in the Caribbean basin.

### Cement: Diversifying Supply Base

Portland cement (HS 2523) remained Haiti's second-largest import category by tonnage, reaching approximately **1.05 billion kg**. The supplier landscape, however, underwent significant restructuring.

Turkey retained the top position at 449.9 million kg, though this represented a modest **2.5%** decline from 2024. Egypt held steady at 236.5 million kg, essentially flat year-over-year. The notable shifts came from emerging suppliers:

- **Vietnam** surged **161.6%** to 149.1 million kg, reaching an all-time high
- **Dominican Republic** jumped **686.5%** to 117.2 million kg
- **Panama** expanded **541.9%** to 64.4 million kg, also an all-time high
- **United States** emerged from near-zero to 36.1 million kg

Meanwhile, **Colombia** collapsed from 29.3 million kg to just 24,200 kg—a **99.9%** decline that effectively removed it from Haiti's cement supply chain.

This diversification appears driven by both demand growth and supply chain resilience considerations. The emergence of regional suppliers (Dominican Republic, Panama) alongside continued Asian flows (Vietnam) suggests importers are actively managing supplier concentration risk.

### Grains: Rice and Wheat Dynamics

Rice (HS 1006) imports reached **477.3 million kg**, with the United States dominating at 345.0 million kg (72.3% share), down modestly **2.6%** from 2024. Pakistan, the second-largest supplier, saw volumes decline **26.6%** to 104.7 million kg, while India grew **47.2%** to 21.1 million kg.

The Pakistan decline and India gain suggest some sourcing substitution within the Asian rice market, though the United States' dominant position remained stable. In containerized terms, however, India led with 940 TEU (49.8% share), followed by Pakistan at 643 TEU—reflecting the different shipping modes used by each origin.

Wheat (HS 1001) presented a different story. Imports surged **135.2%** to **220.7 million kg**, all sourced from the United States. This represented an all-time high for U.S. wheat shipments to Haiti, suggesting either increased domestic milling capacity or substitution away from imported flour toward domestic processing.

### Poultry: Strong Growth from Multiple Origins

Poultry meat (HS 0207) imports reached **87.2 million kg**, with the United States leading at 55.9 million kg—up **110.4%** from 2024 and representing an all-time high. Brazil contributed 20.1 million kg, also an all-time high at **67.2%** growth. Colombia added 3.3 million kg of new volume.

In TEU terms, poultry represented **6,600 TEU**, with the United States at 4,200 TEU (63.8% share) and Brazil at 1,500 TEU (23.0% share). The strong growth across multiple origins suggests robust demand expansion rather than simple sourcing substitution.

### Sugar: Regional Concentration

Sugar (HS 1701) imports totaled approximately **175.4 million kg**, sourced primarily from Central American and South American origins. Guatemala led at 49.2 million kg (28.1% share), up **24.2%**, followed by Colombia at 47.9 million kg (27.3% share), down **18.9%**. El Salvador, Honduras, and Brazil rounded out the top five.

Nicaragua's sugar exports to Haiti collapsed **84.2%** to just 6.9 million kg from 43.6 million kg—one of the year's most significant single-origin declines. This drop was partially offset by Guatemala's gains, but the overall sugar supply chain appears to be consolidating around fewer, larger suppliers.

### Mixed Cargo and Unspecified Goods

The catch-all category (HS 9999) for commodities not specified according to kind reached **283.8 million kg** in tonnage and **22,200 TEU** in containerized volume. The United States dominated at 207.4 million kg (73.1% share) and 13,700 TEU (61.5% share), though U.S. tonnage declined **27.7%** while TEU volume rose **46.9%**.

China's share of this category grew notably, with tonnage up **103.7%** to 55.7 million kg and TEU up **90.5%** to 5,600 TEU. This category often captures consolidated shipments of consumer goods, household items, and other mixed merchandise—suggesting China's growing role in supplying Haiti's consumer economy.

## Part III: Country Dynamics

The country-level picture in 2025 reveals a market in transition, with China gaining share across nearly every metric while traditional suppliers like the United States and Turkey saw mixed results.

### United States: Still Dominant, But Losing Ground in Tonnage

The United States remained Haiti's largest import partner by a significant margin, but its position showed signs of erosion. Tonnage declined **6.5%** to **1.17 billion kg**, representing **28.6%** market share—down from 29.9% in 2024. This 1.3 percentage point share loss, while modest, continues a multi-year trend of gradual U.S. share erosion.

The tonnage decline, however, masked strength in containerized trade. U.S. TEU volume rose **33.9%** to **27,500 TEU**, capturing **27.1%** market share. Shipments grew **32.5%** to 22,300, representing **51.3%** of all shipments—meaning more than half of all individual consignments arriving in Haiti originated from the United States. Container movements rose **39.1%** to 14,700, and vrac shipments grew **11.6%** to 11,700.

The divergence between declining tonnage and rising containerized metrics reflects the commodity mix shift discussed earlier. The United States lost significant volume in bulk categories (particularly the collapse in public transport vehicles from 147.5 million kg to 8.6 million kg) while gaining in containerized consumer goods and food products.

U.S. goods arrived through multiple origin ports, with **Port Everglades, FL** leading in shipments (9,700) and TEU (12,800), while **New Orleans, LA** led in tonnage (385.1 million kg) driven by grain shipments. **Houston, TX** contributed 302.4 million kg and 2,900 TEU, while **Miami, FL** handled 10,100 shipments—the highest shipment count of any origin port.

### China: The Year's Standout Performer

China's expansion across all metrics represented the most significant country-level development of 2025. Tonnage surged **83.0%** to **312.4 million kg**, lifting market share from 5.0% to **7.6%**—a gain of 2.7 percentage points.

The containerized metrics were even more striking. TEU volume jumped **67.1%** to **27,100 TEU**, capturing **26.7%** market share (up from 21.6%). This means China now rivals the United States in containerized import volume, despite handling less than one-third of U.S. tonnage. Shipments rose **66.5%** to 8,400, and containers grew **70.9%** to 14,800.

What drove China's surge? The commodity drill-down reveals several factors:

- **Mixed cargo (HS 9999)** rose **103.7%** to 55.7 million kg
- **Steel bars and rods (HS 7214)** exploded from 169,700 kg to 19.8 million kg—an **11,560.7%** increase
- **Motorcycles (HS 8711)** grew **197.8%** to 12.8 million kg
- **Iron/steel articles (HS 7326)** rose **205.3%** to 11.2 million kg
- **Wire and cables (HS 7312)** jumped **870.0%** to 6.5 million kg

This product mix—construction materials, vehicles, and consumer goods—suggests China is capturing share in Haiti's infrastructure and consumer markets simultaneously. The steel bar surge is particularly notable, as it indicates either new construction demand or substitution away from other steel suppliers.

### U.S. Virgin Islands: Energy Dominance Continues

The U.S. Virgin Islands maintained its role as Haiti's primary petroleum supplier, with tonnage rising **30.4%** to **526.4 million kg**—representing **12.9%** of Haiti's total imports. Virtually all of this volume (519.9 million kg) consisted of petroleum oils from the St. Croix refinery.

The territory's containerized presence remained minimal (20 TEU, 185 shipments), reflecting its specialized role as an energy supplier rather than a diversified trade partner. All shipments originated from **St. Croix**, which served as the single origin port for this trade relationship.

### Turkey: Steady Cement Supplier

Turkey held its position as Haiti's third-largest supplier by tonnage at **471.7 million kg**, essentially flat year-over-year at **-0.8%**. Market share declined modestly from 13.5% to **11.5%** as other suppliers grew faster.

Turkey's trade with Haiti remained concentrated in cement (449.9 million kg), with **Iskenderun** serving as the primary origin port (294.2 million kg). TEU volume rose **29.2%** to 652, and containers grew **38.0%** to 476, suggesting some diversification beyond bulk cement into containerized goods.

### Dominican Republic: Regional Partner Gains Share

The Dominican Republic emerged as a notable gainer, with tonnage rising **39.8%** to **281.3 million kg** and market share climbing from 5.7% to **6.9%**. TEU volume grew **37.9%** to 4,300, shipments rose **49.7%** to 1,600, and containers increased **41.2%** to 2,200.

The commodity breakdown reveals the drivers:

- **Cement (HS 2523)** surged **686.5%** to 117.2 million kg
- **Steel structures (HS 7308)** jumped from near-zero to 15.7 million kg
- **Prepared binders (HS 3824)** grew **35.2%** to 36.3 million kg

Meanwhile, **petroleum oils (HS 2710)** collapsed **83.8%** to 10.7 million kg, suggesting the Dominican Republic is transitioning from an energy intermediary to a construction materials supplier for Haiti.

**Rio Haina** served as the primary origin port, handling 193.8 million kg—up **205.8%** from 2024. The proximity advantage (shared island of Hispaniola) appears to be driving increased trade in heavy construction materials where shipping costs matter significantly.

### Vietnam: Cement Surge Drives Growth

Vietnam posted the strongest percentage growth among major suppliers, with tonnage surging **131.4%** to **160.0 million kg**. Market share rose from 2.0% to **3.9%**, a gain of 1.9 percentage points.

Cement dominated the commodity mix at 149.1 million kg, up **161.6%** and representing an all-time high. **Halong** served as the primary origin port at 149.2 million kg, up **161.7%**. The containerized metrics showed more modest growth (TEU up **12.4%** to 911), reflecting cement's bulk shipping characteristics.

### Egypt: Stable Cement Supplier

Egypt maintained steady volumes at **246.9 million kg**, up **3.4%**, with cement comprising the vast majority at 236.5 million kg. TEU volume jumped **358.0%** to 442, suggesting some diversification into containerized goods, while **Alexandria** served as the primary origin port at 131.7 million kg.

### Indonesia and Pakistan: Diverging Paths

Indonesia held relatively steady at **112.2 million kg** (+5.4%), with TEU essentially flat at 2,100. The country supplies a diversified basket including ceramics, textiles, and food products.

Pakistan, by contrast, declined **26.1%** to **105.6 million kg**, driven primarily by the rice decline discussed earlier. TEU fell **16.5%** to 728, and containers dropped **20.6%** to 647. Market share fell from 4.0% to **2.6%**, a loss of 1.5 percentage points.

### Brazil: Steady Diversified Supplier

Brazil grew modestly at **96.3 million kg** (+9.4%), with TEU up **5.3%** to 6,000. The country supplies a diversified mix including poultry (20.1 million kg, all-time high), sugar (19.9 million kg), ceramics (12.6 million kg), and processed meats (9.8 million kg).

## Part IV: Carrier & Shipping Analysis

The carrier landscape in 2025 featured significant market share shifts, with Evergreen emerging as the fastest-growing major line while private carriers continued to dominate bulk movements.

### Private Carriers: Bulk Movement Specialists

Private carriers collectively handled the largest share of Haiti's import tonnage, reflecting the importance of bulk commodities (petroleum, cement, grains) that move outside standard container shipping.

**PRIVATE CARRIER - RVAM** led all carriers with **850.5 million kg** (+4.7%), representing **20.8%** of total tonnage. This carrier handled 452 vrac shipments, suggesting specialization in bulk petroleum or cement movements.

**NYK LINE** ranked second at **520.3 million kg** (+8.5%), capturing **12.7%** market share with 68 vrac shipments. **PRIVATE CARRIER - QSA** followed at **350.5 million kg** (-6.3%), while **PRIVATE CARRIER - MOS** handled **315.9 million kg** (+9.1%).

These private carriers operate zero TEU and zero containers, confirming their exclusive focus on bulk/break-bulk cargo.

### Container Lines: Evergreen's Surge

Among containerized carriers, **Evergreen** posted the strongest growth, with tonnage surging **80.5%** to **210.3 million kg** and TEU jumping **87.4%** to **18,300 TEU**. This performance lifted Evergreen's TEU market share to **18.0%**, making it the largest container line serving Haiti by this metric.

Shipments rose **85.8%** to 4,900, and containers grew **81.7%** to 10,400. The consistency of growth across all metrics suggests Evergreen gained share through both new customer acquisition and increased volumes from existing relationships.

**Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC)** also posted strong growth, with tonnage up **46.4%** to **244.5 million kg** and TEU rising **45.1%** to **17,200 TEU** (17.0% market share). Shipments surged **62.9%** to 4,100, and containers grew **51.0%** to 10,900.

**CMA/CGM** presented a mixed picture. Tonnage declined **10.2%** to **227.8 million kg**, while TEU held essentially flat at **17,500 TEU** (17.2% market share). Shipments grew **28.5%** to 5,100, but containers fell **4.2%** to 10,500. This divergence suggests CMA/CGM may be handling more LCL (less-than-container-load) shipments or experiencing cargo mix shifts.

**ZIM Lines** grew across most metrics, with tonnage up **87.6%** to **71.0 million kg** and TEU rising **75.9%** to **6,800 TEU** (6.7% market share). Containers jumped **80.9%** to 3,700.

**Accordia Shipping** showed dramatic shipment growth at **1,804.5%** to 1,700 shipments, though tonnage grew only **1.6%** to 113.0 million kg. This pattern suggests the carrier is handling many small consignments, possibly in the consolidation or freight forwarding segment.

*(GRAPH: Carrier market share by TEU, 2024 vs 2025)*

### National Shipping of America: Multi-Metric Growth

**National Shipping of America** emerged as a notable multi-metric gainer, with tonnage up **161.5%** to 10.3 million kg, TEU rising **188.3%** to 836, shipments growing **384.6%** to 63, and containers jumping **241.7%** to 656. While still a small player by absolute volume, this growth rate suggests the carrier is actively expanding its Haiti service.

---

## Part V: Port Analysis

Haiti's port infrastructure remained concentrated around Port-au-Prince, though secondary ports showed meaningful growth in 2025.

### Ports of Arrival: Port-au-Prince Dominates

**Port-au-Prince** handled **2.79 billion kg** of imports, up **7.5%** from 2024, representing **68.1%** of Haiti's total tonnage. TEU volume reached **73,500** (+32.8%), capturing **72.5%** market share. The port processed 26,000 shipments (59.8% share) and 42,700 containers (72.7% share).

The port's vrac volume, however, declined **40.8%** to 5,000 shipments, suggesting some bulk cargo may be diverting to other facilities or that the commodity mix is shifting toward containerized goods.

**Cap-Haïtien**, Haiti's second port, handled **727.0 million kg** (+1.2%), representing **17.8%** of tonnage. TEU volume grew **36.0%** to **18,200** (18.0% share), while shipments surged **52.4%** to 8,400. Vrac shipments jumped **146.6%** to 1,200, suggesting the port is capturing more bulk traffic.

**Lafito** emerged as a growing containerized gateway, with tonnage up **48.8%** to **304.1 million kg** (7.4% share). TEU held steady at 9,700 (9.6% share), while shipments grew **35.1%** to 2,800. The port's vrac volume surged **260.0%** to 36 shipments, though from a small base.

**Saint Louis du Sud** handled **165.7 million kg** of bulk cargo with zero TEU, indicating specialization in break-bulk commodities—likely cement or other construction materials.

**Miragoane** presented a notable pattern: tonnage collapsed **71.6%** to **104.0 million kg**, yet shipments surged **133.1%** to 4,400 and vrac grew **133.0%** to 4,400. This suggests the port shifted from fewer large bulk shipments to more frequent smaller consignments.

**Gonaïves** showed explosive growth from a tiny base, with tonnage up **5,695.6%** to 1.3 million kg and shipments rising **32,200.0%** to 323. **Les Cayes** similarly emerged with shipments up **40,200.0%** to 403. These patterns suggest new trade routes or port facilities coming online.

*(GRAPH: Port of arrival market share by tonnage, with YoY change indicators)*

### Ports of Origin: Geographic Diversity

Haiti's imports originated from a geographically diverse set of ports, reflecting the country's varied supplier base.

**St. Croix** (U.S. Virgin Islands) led in tonnage at **526.4 million kg** (+30.4%), handling petroleum shipments almost exclusively.

**New Orleans, LA** ranked second at **385.1 million kg** (+31.8%), driven by grain exports (wheat, rice). The port handled 512 TEU and 191 shipments, with 56 vrac movements.

**Houston, TX** contributed **302.4 million kg** (+5.0%) with a more diversified cargo mix, including 2,900 TEU and 598 shipments.

**Iskenderun** (Turkey) handled **294.2 million kg** (+36.9%) of primarily cement cargo.

**Port Everglades, FL** showed a notable divergence: tonnage declined **49.9%** to **221.8 million kg**, yet TEU surged **42.2%** to **12,800** and shipments jumped **95.5%** to **9,700**. This pattern suggests the port is handling more containerized consumer goods and fewer bulk commodities.

**Rio Haina** (Dominican Republic) grew **205.8%** to **193.8 million kg**, reflecting the Dominican Republic's emergence as a construction materials supplier.

**Halong** (Vietnam) reached **149.2 million kg** (+161.7%), driven entirely by cement exports.

**Miami, FL** handled the highest shipment count at **10,100** (+1.9%) and **7,100 vrac** movements, though tonnage was modest at 86.6 million kg. This pattern reflects Miami's role as a consolidation hub for smaller consignments.

## Part VI: Sourcing Shifts & Substitution

Several commodity categories showed meaningful sourcing substitution in 2025, with importers diversifying away from traditional suppliers or responding to price and availability changes.

### Cement: Diversification in Action

The cement market (HS 2523) demonstrated the clearest sourcing substitution pattern. Total imports reached approximately 1.05 billion kg, but the supplier mix shifted significantly:

| Supplier | 2024 Share | 2025 Share | Change |
|----------|------------|------------|--------|
| Turkey | ~46% | 42.7% | -3.3pp |
| Egypt | ~24% | 22.4% | -1.6pp |
| Vietnam | ~6% | 14.2% | +8.2pp |
| Dominican Republic | ~2% | 11.1% | +9.1pp |
| Panama | ~1% | 6.1% | +5.1pp |
| Colombia | ~3% | 0.0% | -3.0pp |
| USA | ~0% | 3.4% | +3.4pp |

This represents a significant diversification away from the Turkey-Egypt duopoly that previously dominated. Vietnam's emergence as a major supplier (all-time high volumes) and the Dominican Republic's surge suggest importers are actively seeking alternatives—whether for price, reliability, or risk management reasons.

Colombia's near-complete exit from the market (from 29.3 million kg to 24,200 kg) warrants attention. This collapse may reflect pricing issues, quality concerns, or logistical challenges that made Colombian cement uncompetitive.

### Rice: Asian Supplier Shifts

The rice market (HS 1006) showed more modest substitution:

| Supplier | 2024 Share | 2025 Share | Change |
|----------|------------|------------|--------|
| USA | ~71% | 72.3% | +1.3pp |
| Pakistan | ~29% | 21.9% | -7.1pp |
| India | ~3% | 4.4% | +1.4pp |

Pakistan's significant share loss appears to have benefited both the United States (which gained slightly) and India (which grew 47.2% in volume). This may reflect Pakistani rice pricing or quality issues, or simply Indian suppliers becoming more competitive in the Haitian market.

### Petroleum: New U.S. Mainland Flows

The petroleum market (HS 2710) saw the emergence of direct U.S. mainland shipments:

| Supplier | 2024 Share | 2025 Share | Change |
|----------|------------|------------|--------|
| U.S. Virgin Islands | ~99% | 77.6% | -21.4pp |
| USA (mainland) | ~0% | 20.4% | +20.4pp |
| Dominican Republic | ~19% | 1.6% | -17.4pp |

The U.S. mainland's emergence as a significant petroleum supplier (136.9 million kg from near-zero) represents a structural shift in Haiti's energy supply chain. This may reflect Gulf Coast refinery capacity, pricing advantages, or supply reliability considerations.

### Steel: China's Dramatic Entry

Steel bars and rods (HS 7214) showed perhaps the most dramatic sourcing shift:

| Supplier | 2024 Share | 2025 Share | Change |
|----------|------------|------------|--------|
| China | ~1% | 43.3% | +42.3pp |
| Turkey | ~1% | 24.1% | +23.1pp |
| Hong Kong | 0% | 13.2% | +13.2pp |
| Egypt | 0% | 8.9% | +8.9pp |
| Dominican Republic | ~10% | 8.9% | -1.1pp |

China's surge from 169,700 kg to 19.8 million kg represents a fundamental restructuring of Haiti's steel supply chain. Combined with Turkey's growth and new flows from Hong Kong and Egypt, this suggests either new construction demand or a complete replacement of previous suppliers.

## Part VII: Top Outliers & Anomalies

The 2025 data contains several significant outliers that warrant attention, both for their magnitude and their potential implications.

### Largest Absolute Movers

**U.S. Virgin Islands → Petroleum Oils (HS 2710):** Volume rose from 349.5 million kg to 519.9 million kg (+48.8%), reaching an all-time high. This 170.4 million kg increase represents the largest absolute gain in the dataset.

**USA → Public Transport Vehicles (HS 8702):** Volume collapsed from 147.5 million kg to 8.6 million kg (-94.2%). This 138.9 million kg decline represents the largest absolute loss, likely reflecting the completion of a specific vehicle import program or fleet renewal cycle.

**USA → Petroleum Oils (HS 2710):** Volume surged from 19,900 kg to 136.9 million kg (+687,395.4%), reaching an all-time high. While the percentage change is extreme due to the small base, the absolute volume (136.9 million kg) is significant and represents a new trade flow.

**USA → Wheat (HS 1001):** Volume rose from 93.9 million kg to 220.7 million kg (+135.2%), reaching an all-time high. This 126.8 million kg increase suggests either increased domestic milling capacity or substitution from imported flour.

**Dominican Republic → Cement (HS 2523):** Volume surged from 14.9 million kg to 117.2 million kg (+686.5%). This 102.3 million kg increase reflects the Dominican Republic's emergence as a regional cement supplier.

### ML-Detected Anomalies

CargoFax's machine learning algorithms flagged several country-commodity combinations as statistically anomalous based on historical patterns:

1. **U.S. Virgin Islands × Petroleum Oils** (anomaly score: -0.842): The 48.8% growth, while significant, falls within expected ranges given historical volatility.

2. **Turkey × Cement** (anomaly score: -0.834): The slight decline (-2.5%) is notable given Turkey's historical growth trajectory.

3. **USA × Rice** (anomaly score: -0.822): The modest decline (-2.6%) represents unusual stability in a typically volatile category.

4. **USA × Cement** (anomaly score: -0.808): The emergence of U.S. cement exports (from 67,600 kg to 36.1 million kg) represents a new trade pattern.

5. **USA × Wheat** (anomaly score: -0.796): The 135.2% surge significantly exceeds historical growth rates.

6. **Dominican Republic × Steel Structures** (anomaly score: -0.795): The emergence of steel structure exports (from near-zero to 15.7 million kg) represents a new trade flow.

These anomalies don't necessarily indicate data quality issues—rather, they highlight trade flows that deviate significantly from historical patterns and may warrant additional investigation.

## Conclusion

Haiti's 2025 import profile reveals a market undergoing meaningful structural transition. The headline 4.3% tonnage growth masks several significant developments:

**First, containerization is accelerating.** The 29.5% TEU growth rate—nearly seven times faster than tonnage expansion—indicates Haiti's import mix is shifting toward containerized goods. This trend has implications for port infrastructure, shipping line strategies, and the types of products entering the Haitian market.

**Second, China is gaining share across nearly every metric.** The 83.0% tonnage surge and 67.1% TEU growth lifted China's market share meaningfully, with the country now rivaling the United States in containerized import volume. The commodity mix—steel, motorcycles, consumer goods—suggests China is capturing share in both infrastructure and consumer markets.

**Third, supplier diversification is occurring in key categories.** The cement market's shift away from Turkey-Egypt dominance toward Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, and Panama reflects active supply chain management by Haitian importers. Similar patterns appear in rice (India gaining from Pakistan) and petroleum (U.S. mainland emerging alongside U.S. Virgin Islands).

**Fourth, regional suppliers are gaining importance.** The Dominican Republic's 39.8% tonnage growth and Panama's 315.9% surge (driven by cement) suggest proximity advantages are becoming more valuable—whether for cost, reliability, or risk management reasons.

**Fifth, the United States remains dominant but faces erosion.** While still Haiti's largest supplier by a significant margin, the United States lost 1.3 percentage points of tonnage share and saw absolute tonnage decline 6.5%. The shift toward containerized goods (TEU up 33.9%) may partially offset this trend, but the direction is clear.

For supply chain professionals, these patterns suggest several considerations: monitoring China's continued expansion, evaluating regional sourcing options for construction materials, and tracking the containerization trend's implications for logistics and distribution.

## Methodology Note

This report is based on **bill of lading (BOL) data** compiled by CargoFax, covering all recorded import shipments arriving at Haitian ports during calendar year 2025. The data includes:

- **Tonnage (kg):** Weight of goods as declared on bills of lading
- **TEU:** Twenty-foot equivalent units, measuring containerized cargo volume
- **Shipments:** Individual consignment records
- **Containers:** Physical container movements
- **Vrac:** Bulk and break-bulk shipments outside standard containers

**Limitations:**
- BOL data captures declared weights and may differ from actual weights
- Some shipments may be recorded under catch-all categories (HS 9999)
- Private carrier designations may aggregate multiple operators
- Year-over-year comparisons reflect the data available in each period

**Data processing:**
- Country and commodity totals exclude any aggregated "total" rows to prevent double-counting
- Percentage changes are calculated from prior-year values; extreme percentages (>1,000%) typically reflect small bases
- Market share calculations use the current period's total as the denominator
